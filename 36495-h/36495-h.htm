<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The Book which is here presented to the public is
founded upon a French work by M. Flammarion which
has enjoyed considerable popularity. It contained a
number of interesting accounts of the various ideas, sometimes
mythical, sometimes intended to be serious, that
had been entertained concerning the heavenly bodies and
our own earth; with a popular history of the earliest commencement
of astronomy among several ancient peoples.
It was originally written in the form of conversations
between the members of an imaginary party at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
seaside. It was thought that this style would hardly be
so much appreciated by English as by French readers, and
therefore in presenting the materials of the French author
in an English dress the conversational form has been
abandoned. Several facts of extreme interest in relation
to the early astronomical myths and the development of
the science among the ancients having been brought to
light, especially by the researches of Mr. Haliburton, a
considerable amount of new matter, including the whole
chapter on the Pleiades, has been introduced, which makes
the present issue not exactly a translation, but rather a
book founded on the French author's work. It is hoped
that it may be found of interest to those who care to
know about the early days of the oldest of our sciences,
which is now attracting general attention again by the
magnitude of its recent advances. Astronomy also, in early
days, as will be seen by a perusal of this book, was so
mixed up with all the affairs of life, and contributed so
much even to religion, that a history of its beginnings is
found to reveal the origin of several of our ideas and
habits, now apparently quite unconnected with the science.
There is matter of interest here, therefore, for those who
wish to know only the history of the general ideas of
mankind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST BEGINNINGS OF ASTRONOMY.</h3>


<p>Astronomy is an ancient science; and though of late it has
made a fresh start in new regions, and we are opening on
the era of fresh and unlooked-for discoveries which will soon
reveal our present ignorance, our advance upon primitive
ideas has been so great that it is difficult for us to realize
what they were without an attentive and not uninstructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
study of them. No other science, not even geology, can
compare with astronomy for the complete revolution which
it has effected in popular notions, or for the change it has
brought about in men's estimate of their place in creation.
It is probable that there will always be men who believe that
the whole universe was made for their benefit; but, however
this may be, we have already learned from astronomy that our
habitation is not that central spot men once deemed it, but
only an ordinary planet circulating round an ordinary star,
just as we are likely also to learn from biology, that we
occupy the position, as animals, of an ordinary family in an
ordinary class.</p>

<p>That we may more perfectly realize this strange revolution
of ideas, we must throw ourselves as far as possible into
the feeling and spirit of our ancestors, when, without the
knowledge we now possess, they contemplated, as they could
not fail to do, the marvellous and awe-inspiring phenomena
of the heavens by night. To them, for many an age, the
sun and moon and stars, with all the planets, seemed absolutely
to rise, to shine, and to set; the constellations to
burst out by night in the east, and travel slowly and in
silence to the west; the ocean waves to rise and fall and
beat against the rock-bound shore as if endowed with life;
and even in the infancy of the intellect they must have
longed to pierce the secrets of this mysterious heavenly
vault, and to know the nature of the starry firmament as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
seemed to them, and the condition of the earth which
appeared in the centre of these universal movements. The
simplest hypothesis was for them the truth, and they believed
that the sky was in reality a lofty and extended
canopy bestudded with stars, and the earth a vast plain, the
solid basis of the universe, on which dwelt man, sole creature
that lifted his eyes and thoughts above. Two distinct
regions thus appeared to compose the whole system&mdash;the
upper one, or the air, in which were the moving stars, the
lights of heaven, and the firmament over all; and the lower
one, or earth and sea, adorned on the surface with the products
of life, and below with the minerals, metals, and
stones. For a long time the various theories of the universe,
grotesque and changing as they might be, were but modifications
of this one central idea, the earth below, the
heavens above, and on this was based every religious system
that was promulgated&mdash;the very phrases founded upon it remaining
to this day for a testimony to the intimate relation
thus manifested between the infant ideas in astronomy and
theology. No wonder that early revolutions in the conceptions
in one science were thought to militate against the
other. It is only when the thoughts on both are enlarged
that it is seen that their connection is not necessary, but
accidental, or, at least, inevitable only in the infancy of
both.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to estimate fully the enormous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
change from these ideas representing the appearances to
those which now represent the reality; or to picture to
ourselves the total revolution in men's minds before they
could transform the picture of a vast terrestrial surface, to
which the sun and all the heavenly bodies were but accessories
for various purposes, to one in which the earth is but
a planet like Mars, moving in appearance among the stars,
as it does, and rotating with a rapidity that brings a whole
hemisphere of the heavens into view through the course of
a single day and night. At first sight, what a loss of dignity!
but, on closer thought, what a gain of grandeur! No longer
some little neighbouring lights shine down upon us from a
solid vault; but we find ourselves launched into the sea of
infinity; with power to gaze into its almost immeasurable
depths.</p>

<p>To appreciate rightly our position, we have to plant ourselves,
in imagination, in some spot removed from the surface
of the earth, where we may be uninfluenced by her motion,
and picture to ourselves what we should see. Were we
placed in some spot far enough removed from the earth,
we should find ourselves in eternal day; the sun would ever
shine, for no great globe would interpose itself between it
and our eyes; there would be no night there. Were we in
the neighbourhood of the earth's orbit, and within it, most
wonderful phenomena would present themselves. At one
time the earth would appear but an ordinary planet, smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
than Venus, but, as time wore on, unmeasured by recurring
days or changing seasons, it would gradually be seen to increase
in size&mdash;now appearing like the moon at the full, and
shining like her with a silver light. As it came nearer, and
its magnitude increased, the features of the surface would be
distinguished; the brighter sea and the darker shining continents,
with the brilliant ice-caps at the poles; but, unlike
what we see in the moon, these features would appear to
move, and, one after another, every part of the earth would
be visible. The actual time required for all to pass before us
would be what we here call a day and night. And still,
as it rotates, the earth passes nearer to us, assumes its
largest apparent size, and so gradually decreasing again,
becomes once more, after the interval we here call a year,
an ordinary-looking star-like planet. To us, in these days,
this description is easy of imagination; we find no difficulty in
picturing it to ourselves; but, if we will think for a moment
what such an idea would have been to the earliest observers
of astronomy, we shall better appreciate the vast change
that has taken place&mdash;how we are removed from them, as
we may say, <i>toto c&#339;lo</i>.</p>

<p>But not only as to the importance of the earth in the
universe, but on other matters connected with astronomy, we
perceive the immensity of the change in our ideas&mdash;in that
of distance, for instance. This celestial vault of the ancients
was near enough for things to pass from it to us; it was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
close connection with the earth, supported by it, and therefore
of less diameter; but now, when our distance from the
sun is expressed by numbers that we may write, indeed,
but must totally fail to adequately appreciate, and the distance
from the <i>next</i> nearest star is such, that with the velocity
of light&mdash;a velocity we are accustomed to regard as instantaneous&mdash;we
should only reach it after a three years' journey,
we are reminded of the pathetic lines of Thomas Hood:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"I remember, I remember, the fir trees straight and high,<br />
And how I thought their slender tops were close against the sky;<br />
It was a childish fantasy, but now 'tis little joy,<br />
To know I'm further off from heaven than when I was a boy."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The astronomer's answer to the last line would be that as
far as the material heaven goes, we are just as much in
it as the stars or as any other member of the universe;
we cannot, therefore, be far off or near to it.</p>

<p>It is probable that we are even yet but little awake to
true cosmical ideas in other respects;&mdash;as to velocity, for
instance. We know indeed, of light and electricity and the
motions of the earth, but revelations are now being made to
us of motions of material substances in the sun with such
velocities that in comparison with them any motions on
the earth appear infinitesimally small. Our progress to
our present notions, and appreciations of the truth of nature
in the heavens, will thus occupy much of our thoughts;
but we must also recount the history of the acquirement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of those facts which have ultimately become the basis for
our changes of idea.</p>

<p>Our rustic forefathers, whatever their nation, were not
so enamoured of the "wonders of science"&mdash;that their astronomy
was greatly a collection of theories, though theories,
and wild ones, they had; it was a more practical matter,
and was believed too by them to be more practical than
we now find reason to believe to be the case. They noticed
the various seasons, and they marked the changes in the
appearances of the heavens that accompanied them; they
connected the two together, and conceived the latter to be
the cause of the former, and so, with other apparently uncertain
events. The celestial phenomena thus acquired a
fictitious importance which rendered their study of primary
necessity, but gave no occasion for a theory.</p>

<p>That we may better appreciate the earliest observations on
astronomy, it may be well to mention briefly what are the
varying phenomena which may most easily be noticed. If
we except the phases of the moon, which almost without
observation would force their recognition on people who
had no other than lunar light by night, and which must
therefore, from the earliest periods of human history have
divided time into lunar months; there are three different
sets of phenomena which depend on the arrangement of our
planetary system, and which were early observed.</p>

<p>The first of these depends upon the earth's rotation on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
its axis, the result of which is that the stars appear to revolve
with a uniform motion from east to west; the velocity increasing
with the distance from the pole star, which remains
nearly fixed. This circumstance is almost as easy of observation
as the phases of the moon, and was used from
the earliest ages to mark the passage of time during the
night. The next arises from the motion of the earth in her
orbit about the sun, by which it happens that the earth is
in a different position with respect to the sun every night,
and, therefore, a different set of stars are seen in his neighbourhood;
these are setting with him, and therefore also
a different set are just rising at sunset every evening. These
changes, which would go through the cycle in a year, are, of
course, less obvious, but of great importance as marking the
approach of the various seasons during ages in which the
hour of the sun's rising could not be noted by a clock. The
last depends on the proper motions of the moon and planets
about the earth and sun respectively, by reason of which
those heavenly bodies occupy varying positions among the
stars. Only a careful and continuous scrutiny of the heavens
would detect these changes, except, perhaps, in the case of
the moon, and but little of importance really depends on
them; nevertheless, they were very early the subject of
observation, as imagination lent them a false value, and in
some cases because their connection with eclipses was perceived.
The practical cultivation of astronomy amongst the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
earliest people had always reference to one or other of these
three sets of appearances, and the various terms and signs
that were invented were intended for the clearer exposition
of the results of their observations on these points.</p>

<p>In looking therefore into extreme antiquity we shall find
in many instances our only guide to what their knowledge
was is the way in which they expressed these results.</p>

<p>We do not find, and perhaps we should scarcely expect to
find, any one man or even one nation who laid the foundation
of astronomy&mdash;for it was an equal necessity for all, and was
probably antecedent to the practice of remembering men by
their names. We cannot, either, conjecture the antiquity of
ideas and observations met with among races who are themselves
the only record of their past; and if we are to find
any origins of the science, it is only amongst those nations
which have been cultivators of arts by which their ancient
doings are recorded.</p>

<p>Amongst the earliest cultivators of astronomy we may refer
to the Primitive Greeks, the Chinese, the Egyptians, the
Babylonians, and the Aryans, and also to certain traditions
met with amongst many savage as well as less barbarous
races, the very universality of which proclaims as loudly as
possible their extreme antiquity.</p>

<p>Each of the four above-mentioned races have names with
which are associated the beginnings of astronomy&mdash;Uranus
and Atlas amongst the Greeks; Folic amongst the Chinese;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Thaut or Mercury in Egypt; Zoroaster and Bel in Persia and
Babylonia. Names such as these, if those of individuals, are
not necessarily those of the earliest astronomers&mdash;but only
the earliest that have come down to us. Indeed it is very
far from certain whether these ancient celebrities have any
real historical existence. The acts and labours of the earliest
investigators are so wrapped in obscurity, there is such a mixture
of fable with tradition, that we can have no reliance that
any of them, or that others mentioned in ancient mythology,
are not far more emblematical than personal. Some, such as
Uranus, are certainly symbolical; but the very existence of
the name handed down to us, if it prove nothing else, proves
that the science was early cultivated amongst those who have
preserved or invented them.</p>

<p>If we attempt to name in years the date of the commencement&mdash;not
of astronomy itself&mdash;for that probably in some form
was coeval with the race of man itself, but of recorded observations,
we are met with a new difficulty arising from the
various ways in which they reckoned time. This was in
every case by the occurrence of the phases of one or other
of the above-mentioned phenomena; sometimes however they
selected the apparent rotation of the sun in twenty-four hours,
sometimes that of the moon in a month, sometimes the
interval from one solstice to the next, and yet they apparently
gave to each and all of these the same title&mdash;such as
<i>annus</i>&mdash;obviously representing a cycle only, but without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
reference to its length. By these different methods of
counting, hopeless confusion has often been introduced
into chronology; and the moderns have in many instances
unjustly accused the ancients of vanity and falsehood.
Bailly attempted to reconcile all these various methods and
consequent dates with each other, and to prove that practical
astronomy commenced "about 1,500 years before the Deluge, or
that it is about 7,000 years old;" but we shall see reason in the
sequel for suspecting any such attempt, and shall endeavour
to arrive at more reliable dates from independent evidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the remotest antiquity to which we can possibly
mount is that of the Aryans, amongst whom the hymns of
the <i>Rig Veda</i> were composed. The short history of Hebrew
and Greco-Roman civilization seems to be lost in comparison
with this the earliest work of human imagination. When
seeking for words to express their thoughts, these primitive
men by the banks of the Oxus personified the phenomena
of the heavens and earth, the storm, the wind, the rain, the
stars and meteors. Here, of course, it is not practical but
theoretical astronomy we find. We trace the first figuring
of that primitive idea alluded to before&mdash;the heaven above,
the earth below. Here, as we see, is the earth represented
as an indefinite plane surface and passive being forming the
foundation of the world; and above it the sky, a luminous
and variable vault beneath which shines out the fertile and
life-giving light. Thus to the earth they gave the name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
P'RTHOVI, "the wide expanse;" the blue and star-bespangled
heavens they called VARUNA, "the vault;"
and beneath it in the region of the clouds they enthroned
the light DYAUS, <i>i.e.</i> "the luminous air."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/030.jpg" width="453" height="640" alt="Fig. 1." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>From hence, it would appear, or on this model, the early
ideas of all peoples have been formed. Among the Greeks
the name for heaven expresses the same idea of a hollow
vault (&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#955;&#959;&#962;, hollow, concave) and the earth is called &#947;&#942;,
or mother. Among the Latins the name <i>c&#339;lum</i> has the same
signification, while the earth <i>terra</i> comes from the participle
<i>tersa</i> (the dry element) in contradistinction to <i>mare</i> the wet.</p>

<p>In this original Aryan notion, however, as represented by
the figure, we have more than this, the origin of the names
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Deus</i> comes out. For it is easy to trace the
connection between <i>Dyaus</i> (the luminiferous air) and the
Greek word <i>Zeus</i> from whence <i>Dios</i>, &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;, <i>Deus</i>, and the
French word <i>Dieu</i>, and then by adding <i>pater</i> or father we
get <i>Deuspater</i>, <i>Zeuspater</i>, Jupiter.</p>

<p>These etymologies are not however matters beyond dispute,
and there are at least two other modes of deriving the same
words. Thus we are told the earliest name for the Deity was
Jehovah, the word <i>Jehov</i> meaning father of life; and that
the Greeks translated this into <i>Dis</i> or <i>Zeus</i>, a word having,
according to this theory, the same sense, being derived from
&#950;&#945;&#969; to live. Of course there can be no question of the later
word <i>Deus</i> being the direct translation of <i>Dios</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>A third theory is that there exists in one of the dialects
which formed the basis of the old languages of Asia, a word
<i>Yahouh</i>, a participle of the verb <i>n&icirc;h</i>, to exist, to be; which
therefore signifies the self-existent, the principle of life, the
origin of all motion, and this is supposed to be the allusion
of Diodorus, who explaining the theology of the Greeks, says
that the Egyptians according to Manetho, priest of Memphis,
in giving names to the five elements have called the spirit or
ether Youpiter in the <i>proper sense</i> of the word, for the spirit is
the source of life, the author of the vital principle in animals,
and is hence regarded as the father or generator of all beings.
The people of the Homeric ages thought the lightning-bearing
Jupiter was the commencement, origin, end, and middle of all
things, a single and universal power, governing the heavens,
the earth, fire, water, day and night, and all things. Porphyry
says that when the philosophers discoursed on the nature and
parts of the Deity, they could not imagine any single figure
that should represent all his attributes, though they presented
him under the appearance of a man, who was <i>seated</i>
to represent his immovable essence; uncovered in his upper
part, because the upper parts of the universe or region of the
stars manifest most of his nature; but clothed below the
loins, because he is more hidden in terrestrial things; and
holding a sceptre in his left hand, because his heart is the
ruler of all things. There are, besides, the etymologies which
assert that Jupiter is derived from <i>juvare</i> to help, meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the assisting father; or again that he is <i>Dies pater</i>&mdash;the god
of the day&mdash;in which case no doubt the sun would be alluded
to.</p>

<p>It appears then that the ancient Aryan scheme, though
<i>possibly</i> supplying us with the origin of one of the widest
spread of our words, is not universally allowed to do so. This
origin, however, appears to derive support from the apparent
occurrence of the original of another well-known ancient classical
word in the same scheme, that is Varuna, obviously the
same word as &#927;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;, and Uranus, signifying the heavens.
Less clearly too perhaps we may trace other such words to the
same source. Thus the Sun, which according to these primitive
conceptions is the husband of the Earth, which it nourishes
and makes fruitful, was called <i>Savitr</i> and <i>Surya</i>, from which
the passage to the Gothic <i>Sauil</i> is within the limits of known
etymological changes, and so comes the Lithuanian <i>Saull</i>,
the Cymric <i>Haul</i>, the Greek <i>Heilos</i>, the Latin <i>Sol</i>, and the
English <i>Solar</i>. So from their <i>Nakt</i>, the destructive, we get
<i>Nux</i>, <i>Nacht</i>, <i>Night</i>. From <i>Glu</i>, the Shining, whence the participle
<i>Glucina</i>, and so to <i>Lucina</i>, <i>Luena</i>, <i>Luna</i>, <i>Lune</i>.</p>

<p>Turning from the ancient Aryans, whose astronomy we
know only from poems and fables, and so learn but little of
their actual advance in the science of observation, we come to
the Babylonians, concerning whose astronomical acquirements
we have lately been put in possession of valuable evidence by
the tablets obtained by Mr. Smith from Kouyunjik, an account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the contents of which has been given by Mr. Sayce (<i>Nature</i>,
vol. xii. p. 489). As the knowledge thus obtained is more
certain, being derived from their actual records, than any that
we previously possessed, it will be well to give as full an account
of it as we are able.</p>

<p>The originators of Babylonian astronomy were not the Chald&aelig;ans,
but another race from the mountains of Elam, who are
generally called Acadians. Of the astronomy of this race we
have no complete records, but can only judge of their progress
by the words and names left by them to the science, as afterwards
cultivated by the Semitic Babylonians. These last were
a subsequent race, who entering the country from the East,
conquered the original inhabitants about 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, and borrowed
their civilization, and with it their language in the arts
and sciences. But even this latter race is one of considerable
antiquity, and when we see, as we shortly shall, the great
advances they had made in observations of the sun and moon,
and consider the probable slowness of development in those
early ages, we have some idea of the remoteness of the date
at which astronomical science was there commenced. Our
chief source of information is an extremely ancient work
called The <i>Observations of Bell</i>, supposed to have been
written before 1700 <small>B.C.</small>, which was compiled for a certain King
Saigou, of Agave in Babylonia. This work is in seventy books
or parts, and is composed of numerous small earthen tablets
having impressed upon them the cuneiform character in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
they printed, and which we are now able to read. We
generally date the art of printing from Caxton, in 1474,
because it took the place of manuscript that had been previously
in use in the West; but that method of writing, if in
some respects an improvement on previous methods of recording
ideas as more easily executed, was in others a retrogression
as being less durable: while the manuscripts have perished
the impressions on stone have remained to this day, and will
no doubt last longer than even our printed books. These
little tablets represented so many leaves, and in large libraries,
such as that from which those known have been derived,
they were numbered as our own are now, so that any particular
one could be asked for by those who might wish to
consult it. The great difficulty of interpreting these records,
which are written in two different dialects, and deal often with
very technical matters, may well be imagined. These difficulties
however have been overcome, and a good approach to the
knowledge of their contents has been made. The Chald&aelig;ans,
as is well known, were much given to astronomy and
many of their writings deal with this subject; but they did
practical work as well, and did not indulge so much in theory
as the Aryans. We shall have future occasion in this book
to refer to their observations on various points, as they did
not by any means confine themselves to the simplest matters;
much, in fact, of that with which modern astronomy deals,
the dates and duration of eclipses of the sun and moon, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
accurate measurement of time, the existence of cycles in
lunar and solar phenomena, was studied and recorded by them.
We can make some approach to the probable dates of the
invention of some part of their system, by means of the
signs of the Zodiac, which were invented by them and which
we will discuss more at length hereafter. We need only
say at present that what is now the sign of spring, was
not reckoned so with them, and that we can calculate how
long ago it is that the sign they reckoned the spring sign
was so.</p>

<p>Semiramis also raised in the centre of Babylon a temple
consecrated to Jupiter, whom the Babylonians called Bel.
It was of an extraordinary height and served for an observatory.
The whole edifice was constructed with great art in
asphalte and brick. On its summit were placed the statues
of Jupiter, Juno, and Rhea, covered with gold.</p>

<p>The Egyptians have always been named as the earliest
cultivators of astronomy by the Grecian writers, by whom the
science has been handed down to us, and the Chald&aelig;ans have
even been said to have borrowed from them. The testimony
of such writers however is not to be received implicitly, but
to be weighed with the knowledge we may now obtain, as
we have noticed above with respect to the Babylonians, from
the actual records they have left us, whether by actual
records, or by words and customs remaining to the present
day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Herodotus declares that the Egyptians had made observations
for 11,340 years and had seen the course of the sun
change four times, and the ecliptic placed perpendicular to the
equator. This is the style of statement on which opinions
of the antiquity of Egyptian astronomy have been founded,
and it is obviously unworthy of credit.</p>

<p>Diodorus says that there is no country in which the
positions and motions of the stars have been so accurately
observed as in Egypt (<i>i.e.</i> to his knowledge). They have
preserved, he says, for a great number of years registers in
which their observations are recorded. Expositions are found
in these registers of the motions of the planets, their revolutions
and their stations, and, moreover, the relation which
each bears to the birthdays of animals, and its good or evil
influence. They often predicted the future with success.
The earthquakes, inundations, the appearance of comets, and
many other phenomena which it is impossible for the vulgar
to know beforehand, were foreseen by them by means of the
observations they had made over a long series of years.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the French expedition to Egypt, a long
passage was discovered leading from Karnak to Lucksor.
This passage was adorned on each side of the way with a range
of 1600 sphinxes with the body of a lion and the head of a
ram. Now in Egyptian architecture, the ornaments are never
the result of caprice or chance; on the contrary, all is done
with intention, and what often appears at first sight strange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
appears, after having been carefully examined and studied, to
present allegories full of sense and reason, founded on a profound
knowledge of natural phenomena, that the ornaments
are intended to record. These sphinxes and rams of the
passage were probably the emblems of the different signs of
the Zodiac along the route of the sun. The date of the avenue
is not known; but it would doubtless lead us to a high antiquity
for the Egyptian observations.</p>

<p>The like may be said of the great pyramid, which according
to Piazzi Smyth was built about 2170 <small>B.C.</small> Certainly there
are no carvings about it exhibiting any astronomical designs;
but the exact way in which it is executed would seem to indicate
that the builders had a very clear conception of the
importance of the meridian line. It should, however, be
stated that Piazzi Smyth does not consider it to have been
built by the Egyptians for themselves; but under the command
of some older race.</p>

<p>There seem, however, to be indications in various festivals
and observances, which are met with widely over the earth's
surface, as will be indicated more in detail in the chapter
on the Pleiades, that some astronomical observations, though of
the rudest, were made by races anterior even to those whose
history we partially possess; and that not merely because
of its naturalness, but because of positive evidence, we must
trace back astronomy to a source from whence Egyptians,
Indians, and perhaps Babylonians themselves derived it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese astronomy is totally removed from these and
stands on its own basis. With them it was a matter concerning
the government, and stringent laws were enforced on
the state astronomers. The advance, however, that they made
would appear to be small; but if we are to believe their
writers, they made observations nearly three thousand years
before our era.</p>

<p>Under the reign of Hoangti, Yuchi recorded that there was
a large star near the poles of the heavens. By a method
which we shall enlarge upon further on, it can be astronomically
ascertained that about the epoch this observation was
said to be made there was a star (&#945; Draconis) so near the pole
as to appear immovable, which is so far a confirmation of his
statement. In 2169 the first of a series of eclipses was recorded
by them; but the value of their astronomy seems to
be doubtful when we learn that calculation proves that not
one of them previous to the age of Ptolemy can be identified
with the dates given.</p>

<p>Amongst all nations except the Chinese, where it was
political, and the Greeks, where it was purely speculative,
astronomy has been intimately mixed with religious ideas,
and we consequently find it to have taken considerable hold
on the mind.</p>

<p>Just as we have seen among the Indians that the basis
of their astronomical ideas was the two-fold division into
heaven and earth, so among other nations this duality has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
formed the basis of their religion. Two aspects of things
have been noticed by men in the constitution of things&mdash;that
which remains always, and that which is merely transitory,
causes and effects. The heaven and the earth have presented
the image of this to their minds&mdash;one being the eternal existence,
the other the passing form. In heaven nothing seems
to be born, increase, decrease, or die above the sphere of the
moon. That alone showed the traces of alteration in its
phases; while on the other hand there was an image of
perpetuity in its proper substance, in its motion, and the
invariable succession of the same phases.</p>

<p>From another point of view, the heavens were regarded as
the father, and the earth as the mother of all things. For the
principle of fertility in the rains, the dew and the warmth,
came from above; while the earth brought forth abundantly
of the products of nature. Such is the idea of Plutarch, of
Hesiod, and of Virgil. From hence have arisen the fictions
which have formed the basis of theogony. Uranus is said to
have espoused Ghe, or the heavens took the earth to wife, and
from their marriage was born the god of time or Saturn.</p>

<p>Another partly religious, and partly astronomical antagonism
has been drawn between light and darkness, associated
respectively with good and evil. In the days when artificial
lights, beyond those of the flickering fire, were unknown, and
with the setting of the sun all the world was enveloped in
darkness and seemed for a time to be without life, or at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
cut off entirely from man, it would seem that the sun and
its light was the entire origin of life. Hence it naturally
became the earliest divinity whose brilliant light leaping out
of the bosom of chaos, had brought with it man and all the
universe, as we see it represented in the theologies of Orpheus
and of Moses; whence the god Bel of the Chaldeans, the
Oromaza of the Persians, whom they invoke as the source of
all that is good in nature, while they place the origin of all
evil in darkness and its god Ahrinam. We find the glories
of the sun celebrated by all the poets, and painted and represented
by numerous emblems and different names by the
artists and sculptors who have adorned the temples raised to
nature or the great first cause.</p>

<p>Among the Jews there are traditions of a very high antiquity
for their astronomy. Josephus assures us that it was
cultivated before the Mosaic Deluge. According to him it is
to the public spirit and the labour of the antediluvians that we
owe the science of astrology: "and since they had learnt from
Adam that the world should perish by water and by fire,
the fear that their science should be lost, made them erect two
columns, one of brick the other of stone, on which they engraved
the knowledge they had acquired, so that if a deluge
should wash away the column of brick, the stone one might
remain to preserve for posterity the memory of what they
had written. The prescience was rewarded, and the column
of stone is still to be seen in Syria." Whatever we may think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of this statement it would certainly be interesting if we could
find in Syria or anywhere else a monument that recorded
the ancient astronomical observations of the Jews. Ricard
and others believe that they were very far advanced in the
science, and that we owe a great part of our present astronomy
to them; but such a conjecture must remain without proof
unless we could prove them anterior to the other nations,
whom, we have seen, cultivated astronomy in very remote
times.</p>

<p>One observation seems peculiar to them, if indeed it be
a veritable observation. Josephus says, "God prolonged
the life of the patriarchs that preceded the deluge, both on
account of their virtues, and to give them the opportunity
of perfecting the sciences of geometry and astronomy which
they had discovered; which they could not have done if
they had not lived for 600 years, because it is only after
the lapse of 600 years that the <i>great year</i> is accomplished."</p>

<p>Now what is this great year or cycle of 600 years?
M. Cassini, the director of the Observatory of Paris, has discussed
it astronomically. He considers it as a testimony
of the high antiquity of their astronomy. "This period,"
he says, "is one of the most remarkable that have been
discovered; for, if we take the lunar month to be 29 days
12h. 44m. 3s. we find that 219,146&frac12; days make 7,421
lunar months, and that this number of days gives 600 solar
years of 365 days 5h. 51m. 36s. If this year was in use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
before the deluge, it appears very probable it must be
acknowledged that the patriarchs were already acquainted
to a considerable degree of accuracy with the motions of
the stars, for this lunar month agrees to a second almost
with that which has been determined by modern astronomers."</p>

<p>A very similar argument has been used by Prof. Piazzi
Smyth to prove that the Great Pyramids were built by
the descendants of Abraham near the time of Noah; namely,
that measures of two different elements in the measurement
of time or space when multiplied or divided produce a
number which may be found to represent some proportion
of the edifice, and hence to assume that the two numbers
were known to the builders.</p>

<p>We need scarcely point out that numbers have always
been capable of great manipulation, and the mere fact of
one number being so much greater than another, is no proof
that <i>both</i> were known, unless we knew that <i>one</i> of them
was known independently, or that they are intimately connected.</p>

<p>In the case of Josephus' number the cycle during which
the lunar months and solar years are commensurable has
been long discussed and if the number had been 19
instead of 600, we should have had little doubt of its
reference; yet 600 is a very simple number and might refer
to many other cycles than the complicated one pointed out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
by M. Cassini. A similar case may be quoted with regard
to the Indians, which, according to our temperament, may
be either considered a proof that these reasonings are correct,
or that they are easy to make. They say that there are two
stars diametrically opposite which pass through the zodiac
in 144 years; nothing can be made of this period, nor yet
of another equally problematical one of 180 years; but if
we multiply the two together we obtain 25,9&times;20, which is
very nearly the length of the cycle for the precession of
the equinoxes.</p>

<p>In this review of the ancient ideas of different peoples,
we have followed the most probable order in considering
that the observation of nature came first, and the different
parts of it were afterwards individualized and named. It
is proper to add that according to some ancient authors&mdash;such
as Diodorus Siculus&mdash;the process was considered
to have been the other way. That Uranus was an
actual individual, that Atlas and Saturn were his sons or
descendants or followers, and that because Atlas was a great
astronomer he was said to support the heavens, and that his
seven daughters were real, and being very spiritual they
were regarded as goddesses after death and placed in heaven
under the name of the Pleiades.</p>

<p>However, the universality of the ideas seems to forbid
this interpretation, which is also in itself much less natural.</p>

<p>These various opinions lead us to remark, in conclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
that the fables of ancient mythological astronomy must be
interpreted by means of various keys. Allegory is the
first&mdash;the allegory employed by philosophers and poets
who have spoken in figurative language. Their words taken
in the letter are quite unnatural, but many of the fables
are simply the description or explanation of physical facts.
Hieroglyphics are another key. Having become obscure by
the lapse of time they sometimes, however, present ideas
different from those which they originally expressed. It is
pretty certain that hieroglyphics have been the source of
the men with dogs' heads, or feet of goats, &amp;c. Fables also
arise from the adoption of strange words whose sound is
something like another word in the borrowing language connected
with other ideas, and the connection between the
two has to be made by fable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ASTRONOMY OF THE CELTS.</h3>


<p>The numerous stone monuments that are to be found
scattered over this country, and over the neighbouring parts
of Normandy, have given rise to many controversies as to
their origin and use. By some they have been supposed
to be mere sepulchral monuments erected in late times
since the Roman occupation of Great Britain. Such an
idea has little to rest upon, and we prefer to regard them,
as they have always been regarded, as relics of the Druidical
worship of the Celtic or Gaulish races that preceded us in
this part of Europe.</p>

<p>If we were to believe the accounts of ordinary historians,
we might believe that the Druids were nothing more than
a kind of savage race, hidden, like the fallow-deer in the
recesses of their woods. Thought to be sanguinary, brutal,
superstitious, we have learned nothing of them beyond their
human sacrifices, their worship of the oak, their raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
stones; without inquiring whether these characteristics
which scandalize our tastes, are not simply the legacy of
a primitive era, to which, by the side of the tattered
religions of the old Paganism, Druidism remained faithful.
Nevertheless the Druids were not without merit in the
order of thought.</p>

<p>For the Celts, as for all primitive people, astronomy
and religion were intimately associated. They considered
that the soul was eternal, and the stars were worlds successively
inhabited by the spiritual emigrants. They considered
that the stars were as much the abodes of human
life as our own earth, and this image of the future life
constituted their power and their grandeur. They repelled
entirely the idea of the destruction of life, and preferred
to see in the phenomena of death, a voyage to a region
already peopled by friends.</p>

<p>Under what form did Druidical science represent the
universe? Their scientific contemplation of the heavens
was at the same time a religious contemplation. It is
therefore impossible to separate in our history their astronomical
and theological heavens.</p>

<p>In their theological astronomy, or astronomical theology,
the Druids considered the totality of all living beings as
divided into three circles. The first of these circles, the
circle of immensity, <i>Ceugant</i>, corresponding to incommunicable,
infinite attributes, belonged to God alone; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
properly the absolute, and none, save the ineffable being,
had a right there. The second circle, that of blessedness,
<i>Gwyn-fyd</i>, united in it the beings that have arrived at the
superior degrees of existence; this was heaven. The third,
the circle of voyages, <i>Abred</i>, comprised all the noviciate;
it was there, at the bottom of the abysses, in the great oceans,
as Taliesin says, that the first breath of man commenced.
The object proposed to men's perseverance and courage was to
attain to what the bards called the point of liberty, very
probably the point at which, being suitably fortified against
the assaults of the lower passions, they were not exposed
to be troubled, against their wills, in their celestial aspirations;
and when they arrived at such a point&mdash;so worthy
of the ambition of every soul that would be its own
master&mdash;they quitted the circle of Abred and entered that
of Gwyn-fyd; the hour of their recompense had come.</p>

<p>Demetrius, cited by Plutarch, relates that the Druids
believed that these souls of the elect were so intimately
connected with our circle that they could not emerge from
it without disturbing its equilibrium. This writer states,
that being in the suite of the Emperor Claudius, in some
part of the British isles, he heard suddenly a terrible
hurricane, and the priests, who alone inhabited these sacred
islands, immediately explained the phenomenon, by telling
him that a vacuum had been produced on the earth, by the
departure of an important soul. "The great men," he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
"while they live are like torches whose light is always
beneficent and never harms any one, but when they are
extinguished their death generally occasions, as you have
just seen, winds, storm, and derangements of the atmosphere."</p>

<p>The palingenetic system of the Druids is complete in
itself, and takes the being at his origin, and conducts him
to the ultimate heaven. At the moment of his creation,
as Henry Martyn says in his Commentary, the being has
no conscience of the gifts that are latent in him. He is
created in the lowest stage of life, in <i>Annwfn</i>, the shadowy
abyss at the base of <i>Abred</i>. There, surrounded by nature,
submitted to necessity, he rises obscurely through the successive
degrees of inorganic matter, and then through the
organic. His conscience at last awakes. He is man.
"Three things are primarily contemporaneous&mdash;man, liberty,
and light." Before man there was nothing in creation but
fatal obedience to physical laws; with man commences the
great battle between liberty and necessity, good and evil.
The good and the evil present themselves to man in equilibrium,
"and he can at his pleasure attach himself to one
or the other of them."</p>

<p>It might appear at first sight that it was carrying things
too far to attribute to the Druids the knowledge, not indeed
of the true system of the world, but the general idea on
which it was constructed. But, on closer examination, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
opinion seems to have some consistency. If it was from
the Druids that Pythagoras derived the basis of his theology,
why should it not be from them that he derived also that
of his astronomy? Why, if there is no difficulty in seeing
that the principle of the subordination of the earth might
arise from the meditations of an isolated spirit, should
there be any more difficulty in thinking that the principles
of astronomy should take birth in the midst of a corporation
of theologians embued with the same ideas as the philosophers
on the circulation of life, and applied with continued
diligence to the study of celestial phenomena. The Druid,
not having to receive mythological errors, might be led by
that circumstance to imagine in space other worlds similar
to our own.</p>

<p>Independently of its intrinsic value, this supposition rests
also upon the testimony of historians. A singular statement
made by Hecat&aelig;us with regard to the religious rites of Great
Britain exhibits this in a striking manner. This historian
relates that the moon, seen in this island, appears much
larger than it does anywhere else, and that it is possible to
distinguish mountains on its surface, such as there are on
the earth. Now, how had the Druids made an observation
of this kind? It is of not much consequence whether they
had actually seen the lunar mountains or had only imagined
them, the curious thing is that they were persuaded that
that body was like the earth, and had mountains and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
features similar to our own. Plutarch, in his treatise <i>De
facie in orbe Lun&aelig;</i>, tells us that, according to the Druids, and
conformably to an idea which had long been held in science,
the surface of the moon is furrowed with several Mediterraneans,
which the Grecian philosophers compare to the Red
and Caspian seas. It was also thought that immense abysses
were seen, which were supposed to be in communication with
the hemisphere that is turned away from the earth. Lastly,
the dimensions of this sky-borne country were estimated;
(ideas very different to those that were current in Greece):
its size and its breadth, says the traveller depicted by the
writer, are not at all such as the geometers say, but much
larger.</p>

<p>It is through the same author, who is in accordance in this
respect with all the bards, that we know that this celestial
earth was considered by the theologians of the West as the
residence of happy souls. They rose and approached it in
proportion as their preparation had been complete, but, in
the agitation of the whirlwind, many reached the moon that
it would not receive. "The moon repelled a great number,
and rejected them by its fluctuations, at the moment they
reached it; but those that had better success fixed themselves
there for good; their soul is like the flame, which, raising
itself in the ether of the moon, as fire raises itself on that
of the earth receives force and solidity in the same way
that red-hot iron does when plunged into the water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>They thus traced an analogy between the moon and the
earth, which they doubtless carried out to its full development,
and made the moon an image of what they knew here,
picturing there the lunar fields and brooks and breezes and
perfumes. What a charm such a belief must have given to
the heavens at night. The moon was the place and visible
pledge of immortality. On this account it was placed in
high position in their religion; the order of all the festivals
was arranged after that which was dedicated to it; its presence
was sought in all their ceremonies, and its rays were
invoked. The Druids are always therefore represented as
having the crescent in their hands.</p>

<p>Astronomy and theology being so intimately connected
in the spirit of the Druids, we can easily understand that
the two studies were brought to the front together in their
colleges. From certain points of view we may say that the
Druids were nothing more than astronomers. This quality was
not less striking to the ancients in them than in the Chald&aelig;ans.
The observation of the stars was one of their official
functions. C&aelig;sar tells us, without entering more into particulars,
that they taught many things about <i>the form and
dimensions of the earth, the size and arrangements of the
different parts of heaven, and the motions of the stars</i>, which
includes the greater part of the essential problems of celestial
geometry, which we see they had already proposed to
themselves. We can see the same fact in the magnificent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
passage of Taliesin. "I will ask the bards," he says in
his <i>Hymn of the World</i>, "and why will not the bards answer
me? I will ask of them what sustains the earth, since
having no support it does not fall? or if it falls which way
does it go? But what can serve for its support? Is the
world a great traveller? Although it moves without ceasing,
it remains tranquil in its route; and how admirable is that
route, seeing that the world moves not in any direction."
This suffices to show that the ideas of the Druids on material
phenomena were not at all inferior to their conceptions of
the destiny of the soul, and that they had scientific views
of quite another origin from the Alexandrian Greeks, the
Latins, their disciples, or the middle ages. An anecdote
of the eighth century furnishes another proof in favour of
Druidical science. Every one knows that Virgilius, bishop
of Salzburg, was accused of heresy by Boniface before the
Pope Zacharias, because he had asserted that there were
antipodes. Now Virgilius was educated in one of the
learned monasteries of Ireland, which were fed by the
Christian bards, who had preserved the scientific traditions
of Druidism.</p>

<span class="caption">Plate II.&mdash;Druidical Worship.</span>
</div>

<p>The fundamental alliance between the doctrine of the
plurality of worlds and of the eternity of the soul is perhaps
the most memorable character in the thoughts of this ancient
race. The death upon earth was for them only a psychological
and astronomical fact, not more grave than that which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
happened to the moon when it was eclipsed, nor the fall
of the verdant clothing of the oak under the breath of the
autumnal breeze. We see these conceptions and manners,
at first sight so extraordinary, clothe themselves with a
simple and natural aspect. The Druids were so convinced
of the future life in the stars, that they used <i>to lend money to
be repaid in the other world</i>. Such a custom must have
made a profound impression on the minds of those who daily
practised it. Pomponius Mela and Valerius Maximus both
tell us of this custom. The latter says, "After having left
Marseilles I found that ancient custom of the Gauls still
in force, namely, of lending one another money to be paid
back in the infernal regions, for they are persuaded that the
souls of men are immortal."</p>

<p>In passing to the other world they lost neither their personality,
their memory, nor their friends; they there re-encountered
the business, the laws, the magistrates of this
world. They had capitals and everything the same as here.
They gave one another rendezvous as emigrants might who
were going to America. This superstition, so laudable as
far as it had the effect of pressing on the minds of men the
firm sentiment of immortality, led them to burn, along with
the dead, all the objects which had been dear to them, or of
which they thought they might still wish to make use.
"The Gauls," says Pomponius Mela, "burn and bury with
the dead that which had belonged to the living."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>They had another custom prompted by the same spirit,
but far more touching. When any one bade farewell to the
earth, each one charged him to take letters to his absent
friends, who should receive him on his arrival and doubtless
load him with questions as to things below. It is to Diodorus
that we owe the preservation of the remembrance
of this custom. "At their funerals," he says, "they place
letters with the dead which are written to those already dead
by their parents, so that they may be read by them." They
followed the soul in thought in its passage to the other
planets, and the survivors often regretted that they could
not accomplish the voyage in their company; sometimes,
indeed, they could not resist the temptation. "There are
some," says Mela, "who burn themselves with their friends
in order that they may continue to live together." They
entertained another idea also, which led even to worse practices
than this, namely, that death was a sort of recruiting
that was commanded by the laws of the universe for the
sustenance of the army of existences. In certain cases they
would replace one death by another. Posidonius, who visited
Gaul at an epoch when it had not been broken up, and who
knew it far better than C&aelig;sar, has left us some very curious
information on this subject. If a man felt himself seriously
warned by his disease that he must hold himself in readiness
for departure, but who, nevertheless, had, for the moment,
some important business on hand, or the needs of his family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
chained him to this life, or even that death was disagreeable
to him; if no member of his family or his clients were
willing to offer himself instead, he looked out for a substitute;
such a one would soon arrive accompanied by a
troop of friends, and stipulating for his price a certain sum
of money, he distributed it himself as remembrances among
his companions,&mdash;often even he would only ask for a barrel
of wine. Then they would erect a stage, improvise a sort of
festival, and finally, after the banquet was over, our hero
would lie down on the shield, and driving a sword into his
bosom, would take his departure for the other world.</p>

<p>Such a custom, indeed, shows anything but what we
should rightly call civilization, however admirable may have
been their opinions; but it receives its only palliation from
the fact that their indifference to death did not arise from
their undervaluing life here, but that they had so firm a
belief in the existence and the happiness of a life hereafter.</p>

<p>That these beliefs were not separated from their astronomical
ideas is seen from the fact that they peopled the firmament
with the departed. The Milky Way was called the town of
Gwyon (Co&euml;r or Ker Gwydion, Ker in Breton, Caer in Gaulish,
Kohair in Gaelic); certain bardic legends gave to Gwyon as
father a genius called Don, who resides in the constellation
of Cassiopeia, and who figures as "the king of the fairies"
in the popular myths of Ireland. The empyrean is thus
divided between various heavenly spirits. Arthur had for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
residence the Great Bear, called by the Druids "Arthur's
Chariot."</p>

<p>We are not, however, entirely limited to tradition and the
reports of former travellers for our information as to the
astronomy of the Druids, but we have also at our service
numerous coins belonging to the old Gauls, who were of
one family with those who cultivated Druidism in our island,
which have been discovered buried in the soil of France.
The importance which was given to astronomy in that
race becomes immediately evident upon the discovery of
the fact that these coins are marked with figures having
reference to the heavenly bodies, in other words are astronomical
coins. If we examine, from a general point of view,
a large collection of Gaulish medals such as that preserved
in the National Museum of Paris, we observe that among
the essential symbols that occupy the fields are types of
the Horse, the Bull, the Boar, the Eagle, the Lion, the
Horseman, and the Bear. We remark next a great number
of signs, most often astronomical, ordinarily accessory, but
occasionally the chief, such as the sign <span class="symsign">&#8766;</span>, globules surrounded
by concentric circles, stars of five, six, or eight
points, radiated and flaming bodies, crescents, triangles,
wheels with four spokes, the sign <span class="symsign">&#8734;</span>, the lunar crescent,
the zigzag, &amp;c. Lastly, we remark other accessory types
represented by images of real objects or imaginary figures,
such as the Lyre, the Diota, the Serpent, the Hatchet, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Human Eye, the Sword, the Bough, the Lamp, the Jewel,
the Bird, the Arrow, the Ear of Corn, the Fishes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On a great number of medals, on the stateres of Vercingetorix,
on the reverses of the coins of several epochs, we
recognize principally the sign of the Waterer, which appears
to symbolize for one part of antiquity the knowledge of the
heavenly sphere. On the Gaulish types this sign (an amphora
with two handles) bears the name of Diota, and represents
amongst the Druids as amongst the Magi the sciences of
astronomy and astrology.</p>

<p>Some of these coins are represented in the woodcut below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/060.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="Fig. 2." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2.</span>
</div>

<p>The first of these represents the course of the Sun-Horse
reaching the Tropic of Cancer (summer solstice), and brought
back to the Tropic of Capricorn (winter solstice).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>On the second is seen the symbol of the year between the
south (represented by the sun <span class="symsign">&#9737;</span>) and the north (represented
by the Northern Bear). In the third the calendar (or course
of the year) between the sun <span class="symsign">&#9737;</span> and the moon <span class="symsign">&#9790;</span>. Time
the Sun, and the Bear are visible on the fourth. The diurnal
motion of the heavens is represented on the fifth; and lastly,
on the sixth, appears the Watering-pot, the Sun-Horse, and
the sign of the course of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>On other groups of money the presence of the zodiac may
be made out.</p>

<p>These medals would seem to show that some part of the
astronomical knowledge of the Druids was not invented by
themselves, but borrowed from the Chaldeans or others who
in other lands invented them in previous ages, and from
whom they may have possibly derived them from the Phenicians.</p>

<p>We may certainly expect, however, from these pieces of
money, if found in sufficient number and carefully studied,
to discover a good many positive facts now wanting to us,
of the religion, sciences, manners, language, commercial relation,
&amp;c. which belonged to the Celtic civilization. It was
far from being so barbarous as is ordinarily supposed, and
we shall do more justice to it when we know it better.</p>

<p>M. Fillioux, the curator of the museum of Gu&eacute;ret, who
has studied these coins with care, after having sought for
a long time for a clear and concise method of determining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
exactly the symbolic and religious character of the Gaulish
money, has been able to give the following general statements.</p>

<p>The coins have for their ordinary field the heavens.</p>

<p>On the right side they present almost universally the
ideal heads of gods or goddesses, or in default of these, the
symbols that are representative of them.</p>

<p>On the reverse for the most part, they reproduce, either
by direct types or by emblems artfully combined, the principal
celestial bodies, the divers aspects of the constellations,
and probably the laws, which, according to their ancient
science, presided over their course; in a smaller proportion
they denote the religious myths which form the base of the
national belief of the Gauls. As we have seen above, for
them the present life was but a transitory state of the soul,
only a prodrome of the future life, which should develop
itself in heaven and the astronomical worlds with which
it is filled.</p>

<p>Borrowed from an elevated spiritualism, incessantly tending
towards the celestial worlds, these ideas were singularly
appropriate to a nation at once warlike and commercial.
These circumstances explain the existence of these strange
types, founded at the same time on those of other nations,
and on the symbolism which was the soul of the Druidical
religion. To this religious caste, indeed, we must give the
merit of this ingenious and original conception, of turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the reverses of the coins into regular charts of the heavens.
Nothing indeed could be better calculated to inspire the
people with respect and confidence than these mysterious
and learned symbols, representing the phenomena of the
heavens.</p>

<p>Not making use of writing to teach their dogmas, which
they wished to maintain as part of the mysteries of their
caste, the Druids availed themselves of this method of
placing on the money that celestial symbolism of which
they alone possessed the key.</p>

<p>The religious ideas founded on astronomical observations
were not peculiar to, or originated by, the Druids, any more
than their zodiac. There seems reason to believe that they
had come down from a remote antiquity, and been widely
spread over many nations, as we shall see in the chapter
on the Pleiades; but we can certainly trace them to the East,
where they first prevailed in Persia and Egypt, and were
afterwards brought to Greece, where they disappeared before
the new creations of anthropomorphism, though they were
not forgotten in the days of the poet Anacreon, who says, "Do
not represent for me, around this vase" (a vase he had ordered
of the worker in silver), "either the heavenly bodies, or
the chariot, or the melancholy Orion; I have nothing to
do with the Pleiades or the Herdsman." He only wanted
mythological subjects which were more to his taste.</p>

<p>The characters which are made use of in these astro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>nomical
moneys of the Druids would appear to have a more
ancient origin than we are able to trace directly, since they
are most of them found on the arms and implements of the
bronze age. Some of them, such as the concentric pointed
circles, the crescent with a globule or a star, the line in
zigzag, were used in Egypt; where they served to mark the
sun, the month, the year, the fluid element; and they
appear to have had among the Druids the same signification.
The other signs, such as the <span class="symsign">&#8767;</span>, and its multiple combinations,
the centred circles, grouped in one or two, the
little rings, the alphabetical characters recalling the form
of a constellation, the wheel with rays, the radiating discs,
&amp;c. are all represented on the bronze arms found in the
Celtic, Germanic, Breton, and Scandinavian lands. From
this remote period, which was strongly impressed with the
Oriental genius, we must date the origin of the Celtic symbolism.
It has been supposed, and not without reason, that
this epoch, besides being contemporaneous with the Phenician
establishments on the borders of the ocean, was an age
of civilization and progress in Gaul, and that the ideas of
the Druids became modified at the same time that they
acquired just notions in astronomy and in the art of casting
metals. At a far later period, the Druidic theocracy having,
with religious care, preserved the symbols of its ancient
traditions, had them stamped on the coins which they
caused to be struck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>This remarkable fact is shown in an incontestable manner
in the rougher attempts in Gaulish money, and this same
state of things was perpetuated even into the epoch of the
high arts, since we find on the imitation statues of Macedonia
the old Celtic symbols associated with emblems of a Grecian
origin.</p>

<p>In Italy a different result was arrived at, because the
warlike element of the nobles soon predominated over the
religious. Nevertheless the most ancient Roman coins, those
which are known to us under the name of Consular, have
not escaped the common law which seems to have presided,
among all nations, over the origin of money. The two
commonest types, one in bronze of <i>Janus Bifrons</i> with the
<i>palus</i>; the other in silver, the <i>Dioscures</i> with their stars,
have an eminently astronomical aspect.</p>

<p>The comparison between the Gaulish and Roman coins
may be followed in a series of analogies which are very
remarkable from an astronomical point of view. To cite
only a few examples, we may observe on a large number
of pennies of different families, the impression of Auriga
"the Coachman" conducting a quadriga; or the sun under
another form (with his head radiated and drawn in profile);
or Diana with her lunar attributes; or the five planets
well characterised; for example, Venus by a double star, as
that of the morning or of the evening; or the constellations
of the Dog, Hercules, the Kid, the Lyre, and almost all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
those of the zodiac and of the circumpolar region and
the seven-kine (septemtriones). In later times, under the
C&aelig;sars, in the villa of Borgh&egrave;se, is found a calendar whose
arrangements very much recall the ancient Gaulish coin.
The head of the twelve great gods and the twelve signs of
the zodiac are represented, and the drawing of the constellations
establishes a correspondence between their rising
and the position of the sun in the zodiac. It may therefore
be affirmed that in the coinage and works of art in Italy
and Greece, the characteristic influence of astronomical
worship is found as strongly as among the Druids. Nor
have the Western nations alone had the curious habit of
impressing their astronomical ideas upon their coinage, for
in China and Japan coins of a similar description have been
met with, containing on their reverse all the signs of the
zodiac admitted by them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may say, that it was cosmography, that
constructed the dogmas of the Druidical religion, which was,
in its essential elements, the same as that of the old Oriental
theocracies. The outward ceremonies were addressed to the
sun, the moon, the stars, and other visible phenomena; but,
above nature, there was the great generating and moving
principle, which the Celts placed, at a later period perhaps,
among the attributes of their supreme deities.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE CONSTELLATIONS.</h3>


<p>When we look upon the multitude of heavenly bodies
with which the celestial vault is strewed, our attention is
naturally arrested by certain groupings of brilliant stars,
apparently associated together on account of their great
proximity; and also by certain remarkable single stars
which have excessive brilliancy or are completely isolated
from the rest. These natural groups seem to have some
obscure connection with or dependence on each other. They
have always been noticed, even by the most savage races.
The languages of several such races contain different names
for the same identical groups, and these names, mostly
borrowed from terrestrial beings, give an imaginary life to
the solitude and silence of the skies. A celestial globe, as
we know, presents us with a singular menagerie, rich in
curious monsters placed in inconceivable positions. How
these constellations, as they are called, were first invented,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and by whom, is an interesting question which by the
aid of comparative philology we must endeavour now to
answer.</p>

<p>Among these constellations there are twelve which have
a more than ordinary importance, and to which more
attention has always been paid. They are those through
which the sun appears to pass in his annual journey round
the ecliptic, entering one region each month. At least, this
is what they were when first invented. They were called
the zodiacal constellations or signs of the zodiac&mdash;the name
being derived from their being mostly named after living
beasts. In our own days the zodiacal constellations are no
longer the signs of the zodiac.  When they were arranged
the sun entered each one on a certain date. He now is no
longer at the same point in the heavens at that date, nevertheless
he is still said to enter the same sign of the zodiac&mdash;which
therefore no longer coincides with the zodiacal constellation
it was named from&mdash;but merely stands for a
certain twelfth part of the ecliptic, which varies from time
to time. It will be of course of great interest to discover
the origin of these particular constellations, the date of
their invention, &amp;c.; and we shall hope to do so after
having discussed the origin of those seen in the Northern
hemisphere which may be more familiar even than those.</p>

<p>We have represented in the frontispiece the two halves
of the Grecian celestial sphere&mdash;the Northern and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Southern, with the various constellations they contain.
This sphere was not invented by the Greeks, but was
received by them from more ancient peoples, and corrected
and augmented. It was used by Hipparchus two thousand
years ago; and Ptolemy has given us a description of it.
It contained 48 constellations, of which 21 belonged to the
Northern, 15 to the Southern hemisphere, and the remaining
twelve were those of the zodiac, situated along the ecliptic.</p>

<p>The constellations reckoned by Ptolemy contained altogether
1,026 stars, whose relative positions were determined
by Hipparchus; with reference to which accomplishment
Pliny says, "Hipparchus, with a height of audacity too great
even for a god, has ventured to transmit to posterity the
number of the stars!"</p>

<p>Ptolemy's catalogue contains:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>For the northern constellations</td><td align='left'>&nbsp; 361 stars</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>For the zodiacal</td><td align='left'>&nbsp; 350 &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>For the southern</td><td align='left'>&nbsp; 318 &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>or</td><td align='left'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>For all the 48 constellations</td><td align='left'>1,029 &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>or, since 3 of these are named twice</td><td align='left'>1,026 &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of course this number is not to be supposed to represent
the whole of the stars visible even to the naked eye; there are
twice as many in the Northern hemisphere alone, while there
are about 5,000 in the whole sky. The number visible in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a telescope completely dwarfs this, so that more than 300,000
are now catalogued; while the number visible in a large
telescope may be reckoned at not less than 77 millions.
The principal northern constellations named by Ptolemy
are contained in the following list, with the stars of the
first magnitude that occur in each:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Great Bear, or David's Chariot, near the centre.</p>

<p>The Little Bear, with the Pole Star at the end of the tail.</p>

<p>The Dragon.</p>

<p>Cepheus, situated to the right of the Pole.</p>

<p>The Herdsman, or the Keeper of the Bear, with the star
Arcturus.</p>

<p>The Northern Crown to the right.</p>

<p>Hercules, or the Man who Kneels.</p>

<p>The Lyre, or Falling Vulture, with the beautiful star Vega.</p>

<p>The Swan, or Bird, or Cross.</p>

<p>Cassiopeia, or the Chair, or the Throne.</p>

<p>Perseus.</p>

<p>The Carter, or the Charioteer, with Capella Ophiuchus, or
Serpentarius, or Esculapius.</p>

<p>The Serpent.</p>

<p>The Bow and Arrow, or the Dart.</p>

<p>The Eagle, or the Flying Vulture, with Alta&iuml;r.</p>

<p>The Dolphin.</p>

<p>The Little Horse, or the Bust of the Horse.</p>

<p>Pegasus, or the Winged Horse, or the Great Cross.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Andromeda, or the Woman with the Girdle.</p>

<p>The Northern Triangle, or the Delta.</p>

<p>The fifteen constellations on the south of the ecliptic
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Whale.</p>

<p>Orion, with the beautiful stars Rigel and Betelgeuse.</p>

<p>The River Endanus, or the River Orion, with the brilliant
Achernar.</p>

<p>The Hare.</p>

<p>The Great Dog, with the magnificent Sirius.</p>

<p>The Little Dog, or the Dog which runs before, with Procyon.</p>

<p>The ship Argo, with its fine Alpha (Canopus) and Eta.</p>

<p>The Female Hydra, or the Water Snake.</p>

<p>The Cup, or the Urn, or the Vase.</p>

<p>The Raven.</p>

<p>The Altar, or the Perfuming Pot.</p>

<p>The Centaur, whose star Alpha is the nearest to the earth.</p>

<p>The Wolf, or the Centaur's Lance, or the Panther, or the
Beast.</p>

<p>The Southern Crown, or the Wand of Mercury, or
Uraniscus.</p>

<p>The Southern Fish, with Fomalhaut.</p>

<p>The twelve zodiacal constellations, which are of more
importance than the rest, are generally named in the order
in which the sun passes through them in its passage along
the ecliptic, and both Latins and English have endeavoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to impress their names on the vulgar by embodying them
in verses. The poet Ausonius thus catalogues them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"Sunt: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,<br />
Libraque, Scorpius, Arcitenens, Caper, Amphora, Pisces."<br />
</p></div>

<p class="noin">and the English effusion is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"The Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins,<br />
And next the Crab the Lion shines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Virgin and the Scales.</span><br />
The Scorpion, Archer, and He Goat,<br />
The Man that holds the watering-pot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Fish with glittering scales."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>These twelve have hieroglyphics assigned to them, by
which they are referred to in calendars and astronomical
works, some of the marks being easily traced to their origin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/074.jpg" width="640" height="350" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thus <span class="symsign">&#9800;</span> refers to the horns of the Ram; <span class="symsign">&#9801;</span> to the head of
the Bull; <span class="symsign">&#9807;</span> to the joints and tail-sting of the Scorpion;
<span class="symsign">&#9808;</span> is very clearly connected with an archer; <span class="symsign">&#9809;</span> is formed
by the junction of the first two letters &#964; and &#961; in
&#964;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#959;&#962;, the
Sea-goat, or Capricorn; <span class="symsign">&#9806;</span> for the Balance, is suggestive of its
shape; <span class="symsign">&#9810;</span> refers to the water in the Watering-pot; and
perhaps <span class="symsign">&#9811;</span> to the Two Fishes; <span class="symsign">&#9802;</span> for Twins may denote two
sides alike; <span class="symsign">&#9803;</span> for the Crab, has something of its side-walking
appearance; while <span class="symsign">&#9804;</span> for the Lion, and <span class="symsign">&#9805;</span> for the
Virgin, seem to have no reference that is traceable.</p>

<p>These constellations contain the following stars of the
first magnitude&mdash;Aldebaran, Antares, and Spica.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>To these constellations admitted by the Greeks should
be added the Locks of Berenice, although it is not named
by Ptolemy. It was invented indeed by the astronomer
Conon. The story is that Berenice was the spouse and the
sister of Ptolemy Euergetes, and that she made a vow to
cut off her locks and devote them to Venus if her husband
returned victorious; to console the king the astronomer
placed her locks among the stars. If this is a true account
Arago must be mistaken in asserting that the constellation
was created by Tycho Brahe in 1603. The one he did add
to the former ones was that of Antin&ouml;us, by collecting into
one figure some unappropriated stars near the Eagle. At about
the same time J. Bayer, from the information of Vespuccius
and the sailors, added twelve to the southern constellations
of Ptolemy; among which may be mentioned the Peacock, the
Toucan, the Ph&#339;nix, the Crane, the Fly, the Chameleon, the
Bird of Paradise, the Southern Triangle, and the Indian.</p>

<p>Augustus Royer, in 1679, formed five new groups, among
which we may name the Great Cloud, the Fleur-de-Lis, and
the Southern Cross.</p>

<p>Hevelius, in 1690, added 16; the most important being
the Giraffe, the Unicorn, the Little Lion, the Lynx, the Little
Triangle.</p>

<p>Among these newer-named constellations none is more
interesting than the Southern Cross, which is by some
considered as the most brilliant of all that are known. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
account of it, possibly from the Arabs, seems to have
reached Dante, who evidently refers to it, before it had
been named by Royer, in a celebrated passage in his
"Purgatory." Some have thought that his reference to
such stars was only accidental, and that he really referred
only to the four cardinal virtues of theology, chiefly on
account of the difficulty of knowing how he could have
heard of them; but as the Arabs had establishments along
the entire coast of Africa, there is no difficulty in understanding
how the information might reach Italy.</p>

<p>Americus Vespuccius, who in his third voyage refers to
these verses of Dante, does not mention the name of the
Southern Cross. He simply says that the four stars form
a rhomboidal figure. As voyages round the Cape multiplied,
however, the constellation became rapidly more
celebrated, and it is mentioned as forming a brilliant
cross by the Florentine Andrea Corsali, in 1517, and a
little later by Pigafetta, in 1520.</p>

<p>All these constellations have not been considered sufficient,
and many subsequent additions have been made.
Thus Lacaille, in 1752, created fourteen new ones, mostly
characterized by modern names&mdash;as the Sculptor's Studio,
the Chemical Furnace, the Clock, the Compass, the Telescope,
the Microscope, and others.</p>

<p>Lemonnier, in 1766, added the Reindeer, the Solitaire, and
the Indian Bird, and Lalande the Harvestman. Poczobut, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
1777, added one more, and P. Hell another. Finally, in the
charts drawn by Bode, eight more appear, among which the
Aerostat, and the Electrical and Printing Machines.</p>

<p>We thus arrive at a total of 108 constellations. To
which we may add that the following groups are generally
recognized. The Head of Medusa, near Perseus; the
Pleiades, on the back, and the Hyades on the forehead
of the Bull; the Club of Hercules; the Shield of Orion,
sometimes called the Rake; the Three Kings; the Staff of
S. James; the Sword of Orion; the Two Asses in the Crab,
having between them the Star Cluster, called the Stall, or
the Manger; and the Kids, near Capella, in the constellation
of the Coachman.</p>

<p>This brings the list of the constellations to 117, which
is the total number now admitted.</p>

<p>A curious episode with respect to these star arrangements
may here be mentioned.</p>

<p>About the eighth century Bede and certain other theologians
and astronomers wished to depose the Olympian
gods. They proposed, therefore, to change the names and
arrangements of the constellations; they put S. Peter
in the place of the Ram; S. Andrew instead of the Bull;
and so on. In more recent calendars David, Solomon, the
Magi, and other New and Old Testament characters were
placed in the heavens instead of the former constellations;
but these changes of name were not generally adopted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>As an example of these celestial spheres we figure a
portion of one named <i>C&#339;li stellati Christiani hemisphericum
prius</i>. We here see the Great Bear replaced by the
Barque of S. Peter, the Little Bear by S. Michael, the
Dragon by the Innocents, the Coachman by S. Jerome,
Perseus by S. Paul, Cassiopeia by the Magdalene, Andromache
by S. Sepulchre, and the Triangle by S. Peter's mitre; while
for the zodiac were substituted the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century a proposal was made by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Weigel, a professor in the University of Jena, to form a
series of heraldic constellations, and to use for the zodiac
the arms of the twelve most illustrious families in Europe;
but these attempts at change have been in vain, the old
names are still kept.</p>

<p>Having now explained the origin in modern times of 69
out of the 117 constellations, there remain the 48 which
were acknowledged by the Greeks, whose origin is involved
in more obscurity.</p>

<p>One of the first to be noticed and named, as it is now
the most easily recognized and most widely known, is the
<i>Great Bear</i>, which attracts all the more attention that it is
one of those that never sets, being at a less distance from
the pole than the latter is from the horizon.</p>

<p>Every one knows the seven brilliant stars that form this
constellation. The four in the rectangle and the three in
a curved line at once call to mind the form of a chariot,
especially one of antique build. It is this resemblance, no
doubt, that has obtained for the constellation the name of
"the Chariot" that it bears among many people. Among
the ancient Gauls it was "Arthur's Chariot." In France it
is "David's Chariot," and in England it goes by the name
of "King Charles' Wain," and by that of the "Plough."
The latter name was in vogue, too, among the Latins (<i>Plaustrum</i>),
and the three stars were three oxen, from whence
it would appear that they extended the idea to all the seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
stars, and at last called them the <i>seven</i> oxen, <i>septem-triones</i>,
from whence the name sometimes used for the north&mdash;septentrional.
The Greeks also called it the Chariot (&#7949;&#956;&#945;&#958;&#945;),
and the same word seems to have stood sometimes for a
plough. It certainly has some resemblance to this instrument.</p>

<p>If we take the seven stars as representing the characteristic
points of a chariot, the four stars of the quadrilateral
will represent the four wheels, and the three others will
represent the three horses. Above the centre of the three
horses any one with clear sight may perceive a small star
of the fifth or sixth magnitude, called the Cavalier. Each
of these several stars is indicated, as is usual with all the
constellations, by a Greek letter, the largest being denoted
by the first letter. Thus the 4 stars in the quadrilateral
are &#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, and the 3 tail stars &#949;, &#958;, &#951;. The Arabs give to
each star its special name, which in this case are as follows:&mdash;Dubh&eacute;
and M&eacute;rak are the stars at the back; Phegda
and Megrez those of the front; Alioth, Mizat, and Ack&iuml;ar
the other three, while the little one over Mizat is Alcor.
Another name for it is Saidak, or the Tester, the being
able to see it being a mark of clear vision.</p>

<p>There is some little interest in the Great Bear on account
of the possibility of its being used as a kind of celestial
time-keeper, and its easy recognition makes it all the more
available. The line through &#945; and &#946; passes almost exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
through the pole. Now this line revolves of course with
the constellation round the pole in 24 hours; in every such
interval being once, vertical above the pole, and once vertical
below, taking the intermediate positions to right and
left between these times. The instant at which this line
is vertical over the pole is not the same on any two consecutive
nights, since the stars advance each day 4 minutes
on the sun. On the 21st of March the superior passage
takes place at 5 minutes to 11 at night; on the following
night four minutes earlier, or at 9 minutes to 11. In three
months the culmination takes place 6 hours earlier, or at
5 minutes to 5. In six months, <i>i.e.</i> on Sept. 22, it culminates
at 10.55 in the morning, being vertically below the
pole at the same hour in the evening. The following woodcut
exhibits the positions of the Great Bear at the various
hours of September 4th. It is plain from this that, knowing
the day of the month, the hour of the night may be told
by observing what angle the line joining &#945; and &#946; of this
constellation makes with the vertical.</p>

<p>We have used the name <i>Great Bear</i>, by which the constellation
is best known. It is one of the oldest names
also, being derived from the Greeks, who called it Arctos
megale (&#7948;&#961;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#951;), whence the name Arctic; and
singularly enough the Iroquois, when America was discovered,
called it Okouari, their name for a bear. The
explanation of this name is certainly not to be found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/082.jpg" width="580" height="580" alt="Fig. 4." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4.</span>
</div>

<p>the resemblance of the constellation to the animal. The
three stars are indeed in the tail, but the four are in the
middle of the back; and even if we take in the smaller
stars that stand in the feet and head, no ingenuity can
make it in this or any other way resemble a bear. It
would appear, as Aristotle observes, that the name is derived
from the fact, that of all known animals the bear was
thought to be the only one that dared to venture into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
frozen regions of the north and tempt the solitude and
cold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/083.jpg" width="600" height="540" alt="Fig. 5." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 5.</span>
</div>

<p>Other origins of the name, and other names, have been
suggested, of which we may mention a few. For example,
"Ursa" is said to be derived from <i>versus</i>, because the constellation
is seen to <i>turn</i> about the pole. It has been called
the Screw (&#7964;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#951;), or Helix, which has plainly reference
to its turning. Another name is Callisto, in reference to
its beauty; and lastly, among the Arabs the Great and
Little Bears were known as the Great and Little Coffins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
in reference to their slow and solemn motion. These
names referred to the four stars of each constellation, the
other three being the mourners following the bearers. The
Christian Arabs made it into the grave of Lazarus and
the three weepers, Mary, Martha, and their maid.</p>

<p>Next as to the Little Bear. This constellation has evidently
received its name from the similarity of its form to
that of the Great Bear. In fact, it is composed of seven
stars arranged in the same way, only in an inverse order.
If we follow the line from  &#946; to &#945; of the Great Bear
to a distance of five times as great as that between these
stars we reach the brightest star of the Little Bear, called
the Pole Star. All the names of the one constellation have
been applied to the other, only at a later date.</p>

<p>The new constellations were added one by one to the
celestial sphere by the Greeks before they arranged
certain of them as parts of the zodiac. The successive
introduction of the constellations is proved completely by
a long passage of Strabo, which has been often misunderstood.
"It is wrong," he says, "to accuse Homer of
ignorance because he speaks only of one of the two Celestial
Bears. The second was probably not formed at that time.
The Phenicians were the first to form them and to use
them for navigation. They came later to the Greeks."</p>

<p>All the commentators on Homer, Hygin and Diogenes
Laertes, attribute to Thales the introduction of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
constellation. Pseudo-Eratosthenes called the Little Bear
&#934;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;,
to indicate that it was a guide to the Phenicians. A
century later, about the seventeenth Olympiad, Cleostrates
of Tenedos enriched the sphere with the Archer
(&#932;&#959;&#958;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;,
Sagittarius) and the Ram (&#922;&#961;&#953;&#972;&#962;, Aries), and about the
same time the zodiac was introduced into the Grecian sphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/086.jpg" width="550" height="800" alt="The Constellations from the Sea-Shore." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Constellations from the Sea-Shore.</span>
<p class="center">The Swan&mdash;The Lyre&mdash;Hercules&mdash;The Crown&mdash;The Herdsman&mdash;The
Eagle&mdash;The Serpent&mdash;The Balance&mdash;The Scorpion&mdash;Sagittarius.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to the Little Bear there is another passage
of Strabo which it will be interesting to quote. He says&mdash;"The
position of the people under the parallel of Cinnamomophore,
<i>i.e.</i> 3,000 stadia south of Meroe and 8,800
stadia north of the equator, represents about the middle
of the interval between the equator and the tropic, which
passes by Syene, which is 5,000 stadia north of Meroe.
These same people are the first for whom the Little Bear
is comprised entirely in the Arctic circle and remains
always visible; the most southern star of the constellation,
the brilliant one that ends the tail being placed on
the circumference of the Arctic circle, so as just to touch
the horizon." The remarkable thing in this passage is that
it refers to an epoch anterior to Strabo, when the star &#945; of
the Little Bear, which now appears almost immovable,
owing to its extreme proximity to the pole, was then more
to the south than the other stars of the constellation, and
moved in the Arctic circle so as to touch the horizon of
places of certain latitudes, and to set for latitudes nearer
the equator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In those days it was not the <i>Pole</i> Star&mdash;if that word has
any relation to &#960;&#959;&#955;&#941;&#969;, I turn&mdash;for the heavens did not turn
about it then as they do now.</p>

<p>The Grecian geographer speaks in this passage of a period
when the most brilliant star in the neighbourhood of the
pole was &#945; of the Dragon. This was more than three thousand
years ago. At that time the Little Bear was nearer to
the pole than what we now call the Polar Star, for this latter
was "the most southern star in the constellation." If we
could alight upon documents dating back fourteen thousand
years, we should find the star Vega (&#945; Lyra) referred to as
occupying the pole of the world, although it now is at a
distance of 51 degrees from it, the whole cycle of changes
occupying a period of about twenty-six thousand years.</p>

<p>Before leaving these two constellations we may notice
the origin of the names according to Plutarch. He would
have it that the names are derived from the use that they
were put to in navigation. He says that the Phenicians
called that constellation that guided them in their route
the <i>Dobebe</i>, or <i>Doube</i>, that is, the speaking constellation, and
that this same word happens to mean also in that language
a bear; and so the name was confounded. Certainly there
is still a word <i>dubbeh</i> in Arabic having this signification.</p>

<p>Next as to the Herdsman. The name of its characteristic
star and of itself, Arcturus (&#7948;&#961;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962;, bear; &#927;&#8022;&#961;&#959;&#962;,
guardian), is explained without difficulty by its position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
near the Bears. There are six small stars of the third magnitude
in the constellation round its chief one&mdash;three of its
stars forming an equilateral triangle. Arcturus is in the
continuation of the curved line through the three tail stars
of the Great Bear. The constellation has also been called
Atlas, from its nearness to the pole&mdash;as if it held up the
heavens, as the fable goes.</p>

<p>Beyond this triangle, in the direction of the line continued
straight from the Great Bear, is the Northern Crown,
whose form immediately suggests its name. Among the
stars that compose it one, of the second magnitude, is called
the Pearl of the Crown. It was in this point of the heavens
that a temporary star appeared in May, 1866, and disappeared
again in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p>Among the circumpolar constellations we must now speak
of Cassiopeia, or the Chair&mdash;or Throne&mdash;which is situated on
the opposite side of the Pole from the Great Bear; and
which is easily found by joining its star &#948; to the Pole
and continuing it. The Chair is composed principally of
five stars, of the third magnitude, arranged in the form of
an M. A smaller star of the fourth magnitude completes
the square formed by the three &#946;, &#945;, and &#947;. The figure thus
formed has a fair resemblance to a chair or throne, &#948; and &#949;
forming the back; and hence the justification for its popular
name. The other name Cassiopeia has its connection and
meaning unknown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>We may suitably remark in this place, with Arago, that
no precise drawing of the ancient constellations has come
down to us. We only know their forms by written descriptions,
and these often very short and meagre. A verbal
description can never take the place of a drawing, especially
if it is a complex figure, so that there is a certain amount of
doubt as to the true form, position, and arrangement of the
figures of men, beasts, and inanimate objects which composed
the star-groups of the Grecian astronomers&mdash;so that unexpected
difficulties attend the attempt to reproduce them on
our modern spheres. Add to this that alterations have been
avowedly introduced by the ancient astronomers themselves,
among others by Ptolemy, especially in those given by
Hipparchus. Ptolemy says he determined to make these
changes because it was necessary to give a better proportion
to the figures, and to adapt them better to the real positions of
the stars. Thus in the constellation of the Virgin, as drawn
by Hipparchus, certain stars corresponded to the shoulders;
but Ptolemy placed them in the sides, so as to make the
figure a more beautiful one. The result is that modern designers
give scope to their imagination rather than consult
the descriptions of the Greeks. <i>Cassiopeia</i>, <i>Cepheus</i>, <i>Andromeda</i>,
and <i>Perseus</i> holding in his hand the <i>Head of Medusa</i>,
appear to have been established at the same epoch, no doubt
subsequently to the Great Bear. They form one family, placed
together in one part of the heavens, and associated in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
drama; the ardent Perseus delivering the unfortunate Andromeda,
daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia. We can never be
sure, however, whether the constellations suggested the fable,
or the fable the constellations: the former may only mean that
Perseus, rising before Andromeda, seems to deliver it from the
Night and from the constellation of the Whale. The Head of
Medusa, a celebrated woman, that Perseus cut off and holds
in his hand, is said by Volney to be only the head of the
constellation Virgo, which passes beneath the horizon precisely
as the Perseus rises, and the serpents which surround it are
Ophiucus and the polar Dragon, which then occupies the zenith.</p>

<p>Either way, we have no account of the origin of the <i>names</i>,
and it is possible that we may have to seek it, if ever we
find it, from other sources&mdash;for it would appear that similar
names were used for the same constellations by the Indians.
This seems inevitably proved by what is related by Wilford
(<i>Asiatic Researches</i>, III.) of his conversation with his pundit,
an astronomer, on the names of the Indian constellations.
"Asking him," he says, "to show me in the heavens the constellation
of Antarmada, he immediately pointed to Andromeda,
though I had not given him any information about it
beforehand. He afterwards brought me a very rare and
curious work in Sanscrit, which contained a chapter devoted
to <i>Upanacchatras</i>, or extra-zodiacal constellations, with
drawings of <i>Capuja</i> (Cepheus), and of <i>Casyapi</i> (Cassiopeia)
seated and holding a lotus flower in her hand, of <i>Antarmada</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
charmed with the fish beside her, and last of <i>Parasiea</i> (Perseus)
who, according to the explanation of the book, held the
head of a monster which he had slain in combat; blood was
dropping from it, and for hair it had snakes." As the stars
composing a constellation have often very little connection with
the figure they are supposed to form, when we find the same
set of stars called by the same name by two different nations,
as was the case, for instance, in some of the Indian names of
constellations among the Americans, it is a proof that one of
the nations copied it from the other, or that both have copied
from a common source. So in the case before us, we cannot
think these similar names have arisen independently, but
must conclude that the Grecian was borrowed from the Indian.</p>

<p>Another well-known constellation in this neighbourhood,
forming an isosceles triangle with Arcturus and the Pole
Star, is the Lyre. Lucian of Samosatus says that the
Greeks gave this name to the constellation to do honour
to the Lyre of Orpheus. Another possible explanation
is this. The word for lyre in Greek (&#967;&#941;&#955;&#965;&#962;) and in Latin
(<i>testudo</i>) means also a tortoise. Now at the time when this
name was imposed the chief star in the Lyre may have been
very near to the pole of the heavens and therefore have had
a very slow motion, and hence it might have been named the
tortoise, and this in Greek would easily be interpreted into
lyre instead. Indeed this double meaning of the word seems
certainly to have given rise to the fable of Mercury having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
constructed a lyre out of the back of a tortoise. Circling round
the pole of the ecliptic, and formed by a sinuous line of
stars passing round from the Great Bear to the Lyre, is the
Dragon, which owes its name to its form. Its importance is
derived from its relation to the ecliptic, the pole of which is
determined by reference to the stars of the first coil of the
body. The centre of the zodiacal circle is a very important
point, that circle being traced on the most ancient spheres, and
probably being noticed even before the pole of the heavens.</p>

<p>Closely associated with the Dragon both in mythology and
in the celestial sphere is Hercules. He is always drawn
kneeling; in fact, the constellation is rather a man in a
kneeling posture than any particular man. The poets
called it Engonasis with reference to this, which is too
melancholy or lowly a position than would agree well with
the valiant hero of mythology. There is a story related by
&AElig;schylus about the stones in the Champ des Cailloux, between
Marseilles and the embouchure of the Rh&ocirc;ne, to the effect that
Hercules, being amongst the Ligurians, found it necessary to
fight with them; but he had no more missiles to throw; when
Jupiter, touched by the danger of his son, sent a rain of round
stones, with which Hercules repulsed his enemies. The Engonasis
is thus considered by some to represent him bending
down to pick up the stones. Posidonius remarks that it was
a pity Jupiter did not rain the stones on the Ligurians at
once, without giving Hercules the trouble to pick them up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Ophiucus, which comes close by, simply means the man
that holds the serpent &#8000;&#981;&#953;-&#959;&#8166;&#967;&#959;&#962;.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to know the origins of all the
names, as those we now use are only the surviving ones of
several that from time to time have been applied to the
various constellations according to their temporary association
with the local legends. The prominent ones are favoured
with quite a crowd of names. We need only cite a few.
Hercules, for instance, has been called
&#8008;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#950;&#969;&#957; &#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#962;,
Engonasis, Ingeniculus, Nessus, Thamyris, Desanes, Maceris,
Almannus, Al-chete, &amp;c. The Swan has the names of &#922;&#973;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#962;,
&#7996;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#957;, &#8012;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#962;, Olar, Helen&aelig; genitor, Ales Jovis, Led&aelig;us,
Milvus, Gallina, The Cross, while the Coachman has been
&#7993;&#960;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#962;,
&#7960;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;,
&#913;&#7984;&#961;&#969;&#951;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#962;,
&#7980;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#962;, Auriga,
Acator, Hemochus, Erichthonus, Mamsek, Al&aacute;nat, Athaiot,
Alatod, &amp;c. With respect to the Coachman, in some old
maps he is drawn with a whip in his left hand turned
towards the chariot, and is called the charioteer. No doubt
its proximity to the former constellation has acquired for it
its name. The last we need mention, as of any celebrity,
is that of Orion, which is situated on the equator, which
runs exactly through its midst. Regel forms its left foot,
and the Hare serves for a footstool to the right foot of the
hero. Three magnificent stars in the centre of the
quadrilateral, which lie in one straight line are called the
Rake, or the Three Kings, or the Staff of Jacob, or the Belt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
These names have an obvious origin; but the meaning of
Orion itself is more doubtful. In the Grecian sphere it is
written &#8040;&#961;&#943;&#969;&#957;, which also means a kind of bird. The allied
word &#8038;&#961;&#959;&#962; has very numerous meanings, the only one of
which that could be conjectured to be connected with the
constellations is a "guardian." The word &#7989;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;, on the
contrary, the diminutive of &#8037;&#961;&#959;&#962;, means a limit, and has
been assigned to Jupiter; and in this case may have
reference to the constellation being situated on the confines
of the two hemispheres. In mythology Orion was an
intrepid hunter of enormous size. He was the same
personage as Orus, Arion, the Minotaur, and Nimrod, and
afterwards became Saturn. Orion is called <i>Tsan</i> in Chinese,
which signifies three, and corresponds to the three kings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>The Asiatics used not to trace the images of their
constellations, but simply joined the component stars by
straight lines, and placed at the side the hieroglyphic
characters that represented the object they wished to name.
Thus joining by five lines the principal stars in Orion, they
placed at the side the hieroglyphics representing a man
and a sword, from whence the Greeks derived the figure they
afterwards drew of a giant armed with a sword.</p>

<p>We must include in this series that brightest of all stars,
Sirius. It forms part of the constellation of the Great Dog,
and lies to the south of Orion near the extreme limit of
our vision into the Southern hemisphere in our latitudes.
This star seems to have been intimately connected with
Egypt, and to have derived its name&mdash;as well as the name
of the otherwise unimportant constellation it forms part of&mdash;from
that country, and in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>The overflowing of the Nile was always preceded by an
Etesian wind, which, blowing from north to south about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
time of the passage of the sun beneath the stars of the Crab,
drove the mists to the south, and accumulated them over the
country whence the Nile takes its source, causing abundant
rains, and hence the flood. The greatest importance attached
to the foretelling the time of this event, so that people might
be ready with their provisions and their places of security.
The moon was no use for this purpose, but the stars were,
for the inundation commenced when the sun was in the stars
of the Lion. At this time the stars of the Crab just appeared
in the morning, but with them, at some distance from the
ecliptic, the bright star Sirius also rose. The morning
rising of this star was a sure precursor of the inundation. It
seemed to them to be the warning star, by whose first
appearance they were to be ready to move to safer spots, and
thus acted for each family the part of a faithful dog. Whence
they gave it the name of the Dog, or Monitor, in Egyptian
<i>Anubis</i>, in Phenician <i>Hannobeach</i>, and it is still the Dog-Star&mdash;<i>Caniculus</i>,
and its rising commences our <i>dog-days</i>.
The intimate connection between the rising of this star and
the rising of the Nile led people to call it also the Nile star,
or simply the Nile; in Egyptian and Hebrew, <i>Sihor</i>; in
Greek, &#931;&#959;&#952;&#943;&#962;; in Latin, <i>Sirius</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way the Egyptians and others characterised
the different days of the year by the stars which first
appeared in the evening&mdash;as we shall see more particularly
with reference to the Pleiades&mdash;and in this way certain stars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
came to be associated in their calendar with variations of
temperature and operations of agriculture. They soon took
for the cause what was originally but the sign, and thus they
came to talk of moist stars, whose rising brought rain, and
arid stars, which brought drought. Some made certain
plants to grow, and others had influence over animals.</p>

<p>In the case of Egypt, no other so great event could occur
as that which the Dog-Star foretold, and its appearance was
consequently made the commencement of the year. Instead,
therefore, of painting it as a simple star, in which case it
would be indistinguishable from others, they gave it shape
according to its function and name. When they wished to
signify that it opened the year, it was represented as a
porter bearing keys, or else they gave it two heads, one of
an old man, to represent the passing year, the other of a
younger, to denote the succeeding year. When they would
represent it as giving warning of the inundation they painted
it as a dog. To illustrate what they were to do when it
appeared, Anubis had in his arms a stew-pot, wings to his
feet, a large feather under his arm, and two reptiles behind
him, a tortoise and a duck.</p>

<p>There is also in the celestial sphere a constellation called
the Little Dog and Procyon; the latter name has an obvious
meaning, as appearing <i>before</i> the Dog-Star.</p>

<p>We cannot follow any farther the various constellations of
the northern sphere, nor of the southern. The zodiacal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
constellations we must reserve for the present, while we
conclude by referring to some of the changes in form and
position that some of the above-mentioned have undergone
in the course of their various representations.</p>

<p>These changes are sometimes very curious, as, for example,
in a coloured chart, printed at Paris in 1650, we have the
Charioteer drawn in the costume of Adam, with his knees on
the Milky Way, and turning his back to the public; the she-goat
appears to be climbing over his neck, and two little
she-goats seem to be running towards their mother.
Cassiopeia is more like King Solomon than a woman.
Compare this with the <i>Phenomena of Aratus</i>, published
1559, where Cassiopeia is represented sitting on an oak
chair with a ducal back, holding the holy palm in her left
hand, while the Coachman, "Erichthon," is in the costume of
a minion of Henry the Third of France. Now compare the
Cassiopeia of the Greeks with that drawn in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, or the Coachman of the same
periods, and we can easily see the fancies of the painters
have been one of the most fertile sources of change. They
seem, too, to have had the fancy in the middle ages to draw
them all hideous and turning their backs. Compare, for
instance, the two pictures of Andromeda and Hercules, as
given below, where those on one side are as heavy and gross
as the others are artistic and pretty. Unfortunately for the
truth of Andromeda's beauty, as depicted in these designs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
she was supposed to be a negress, being the daughter of
the Ethiopians, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Not one of the
drawings indicates this; indeed they all take after their
local beauties.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 7.</span>
</div>

<p>In Flamsteed's chart, as drawn above, the Coachman is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a female; and instead of the she-goat being on the back, she
holds it in her arms. No one, indeed, from any of the
figures of this constellation would ever dream it was
intended to represent a coachman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
<img src="images/101.jpg" width="620" height="860" alt="Fig. 8." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 8.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>One more fundamental cause of changes has been the
confusion of names derived by one nation from another,
these having sometimes followed their signification, but
at others being translated phonetically. Thus the Latins, in
deriving names from the Greek &#7948;&#961;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962;, have partly translated
it by Ursa, and partly have copied it in the form
Arcticus. So also with reference to the three stars in the
head of the Bull, called by the Greeks Hyades. The Romans
thought it was derived from &#8023;&#949;&#962;, sows, so they called them
<i>sucul&aelig;</i>, or little sows; whereas the original name was derived
from &#8021;&#949;&#953;&#957;, to rain, and signified stars whose appearance
indicated the approach of the rainy season.</p>

<p>More curious still is the transformation of the Pearl of
the Northern Crown (Margarita Coron&aelig;) in a saint&mdash;S.
Marguerite.</p>

<p>The names may have had many origins whose signification
is lost, owing to their being misunderstood. Thus figurative
language may have been interpreted as real, as when a
conjunction is called a marriage; a disappearance, death;
and a reappearance, a resurrection; and then stories must
be invented to fit these words; or the stars that have in one
country given notice of certain events lose the meaning of
their names when these are used elsewhere; as when a
boat painted near the stars that accompany an inundation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
becomes the ship Argo; or when, to represent the wind, the
bird's wing is drawn; or those stars that mark a season are
associated with the bird of passage, the insect or the animal
that appears at that time: such as these would soon lose
their original signification.</p>

<p>The celestial sphere, therefore, as we now possess it, is
not simply a collection of unmeaning names, associated with
a group of stars in no way connected with them, which have
been imposed at various epochs by capricious imagination,
but in most instances, if not in all, they embody a history,
which, if we could trace it, would probably lead us to
astronomical facts, indicating the where and the when of
their first introduction; and the story of their changes, so
far as we can trace it, gives us some clue to the mental
characteristics or astronomical progress of the people who
introduced the alterations.</p>

<p>We shall find, indeed, in a subsequent chapter, that many
of our conclusions as to the birth and growth of astronomy
are derived from considerations connected with the various
constellations, more especially those of the zodiac.</p>

<p>With regard to the date when and the country where the
constellations of the sphere were invented, we will here give
what evidence we possess, independent of the origin of the
zodiac.</p>

<p>In the first place it seems capable of certain proof that
they were not invented by the Greeks, from whom we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
received them, but adopted from an older source, and it is
possible to give limits to the date of introduction among
them.</p>

<p>Newton, who attributes its introduction to Mus&aelig;us, a contemporary
of Chiron, remarks, that it must have been settled
<i>after</i> the expedition of the Argonauts, and <i>before</i> the destruction
of Troy; because the Greeks gave to the constellation
names that were derived from their history and fables, and
devoted several to celebrate the memory of the famous
adventurers known as the Argonauts, and they would
certainly have dedicated some to the heroes of Troy, if the
siege of that place had happened at the time. We remark
that at this time astronomy was in too infant a state in
Greece for them to have fixed with so much accuracy the
position of the stars, and that we have in this a proof
they must have borrowed their knowledge from older
cultivators of the science.</p>

<p>The various statements we meet with about the invention
of the sphere may be equally well interpreted of its introduction
only into Greece. Such, for instance, as that Eudoxus
first constructed it in the thirteenth or fourteenth century
<small>B.C.</small>, or that by Clement of Alexandria, that Chiron was
the originator.</p>

<p>The oldest direct account of the names of the constellations
and their component stars is that of Hesiod, who cites by
name in his <i>Works and Days</i> the Pleiades, Arcturus, Orion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and Sirius. He lived, according to Herodotus, about 884
years before Christ.</p>

<p>The knowledge of all the constellations did not reach the
Greeks at the same time, as we have seen from the omission
by Homer of any mention of the Little Bear, when if he
had known it, he could hardly have failed to speak of it.
For in his description of the shield of Achilles, he mentions
the Pleiades, the Hyades, Orion and the Bear, "which alone
does not bathe in the Ocean." He could never have said
this last if he had known of the Dragon and Little Bear.</p>

<p>We may then safely conclude that the Greeks received the
idea of the constellations from some older source, probably
the Chaldeans. They received it doubtless as a sphere, with
figured, but nameless constellations; and the Greeks by slight
changes adapted them to represent the various real or
imaginary heroes of their history. It would be a gracious
task, for their countrymen would glory in having their great
men established in the heavens. When they saw a ship
represented, what more suitable than to name it the ship
Argo? The Swan must be Jupiter transformed, the Lyre
is that of Orpheus, the Eagle is that which carried away
Ganymede, and so on.</p>

<p>This would be no more than what other nations have
done, as, for example, the Chinese, who made greater changes
still, unless we consider theirs to have had an entirely
independent origin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/106.jpg" width="660" height="690" alt="Fig. 9." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 9.</span>
</div>

<p>That the celestial sphere was a conception known to others
than the Greeks is easily proved. The Arabians, for instance,
certainly did not borrow it from them; yet they have the
same things represented. Above is a figure of a portion of
an Arabian sphere drawn in the eleventh century, where we get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
represented plainly enough the Great and Little Bears, the
Dragon, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Perseus, with the Triple Head
of Medusa; the Triangle, one of the Fishes, Auriga, the Ram,
the Bull obscurely, and the Twins.</p>

<p>There is also the famous so-called zodiac of Denderah,
brought from Egypt to Paris. This in reality contains more
constellations than those of the zodiac. Most of the northern
ones can be traced, with certain modifications. Its construction
is supposed to belong to the eighth century <small>B.C.</small> Most
conspicuous on it is the Lion, in a kind of barque, recalling
the shape of the Hydra. Below it is the calf Isis, with
Sirius, or the Dog-Star, on the forehead; above it is the
Crab, to the right the Twins, over these along instrument, the
Plough, and above that a small animal, the Little Bear, and
so we may go on:&mdash;all the zodiacal constellations, especially
the Balance, the Scorpion, and the Fishes being very clear.
This sphere is indeed of later date than that supposed for
the Grecian, but it certainly appears to be independent.
The remains we possess of older spheres are more particularly
connected with the zodiac, and will be discussed hereafter.</p>

<p>From what people the Greeks received the celestial sphere,
is a question on which more than one opinion has been formed.
One is that it was originated in the tropical latitudes of Egypt.
The other, that it came from the Chaldeans, and a third that
it came from more temperate latitudes further to the east.
The arguments for the last of these are as follow:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an empty space of about 90&deg;, formed by the last
constellations of the sphere, towards the south pole, that
is by the Centaur, the Altar, the Archer, the Southern Fish,
the Whale, and the Ship. Now in a systematic plan, if the
author were situated near the equator there would be no
vacant space left in this way, for in this case the southern
stars, attracting as much attention as the northern, would be
inevitably inserted in the system of constellations which
would be extended to the horizon on all sides. But a
country of sufficiently high latitude to be unable to see at
any time the stars about the southern pole must be north
both of Egypt and Chaldea.</p>

<p>This empty space remained unfilled until the discovery of
the Cape of Good Hope, except that the star Canopus was
included in the constellation Argo, and the river Eridan had
an arbitrary extension given to it, instead of terminating
in latitude 40&deg;.</p>

<p>Another less cogent argument is derived from the interpretation
of the fable of the Ph&#339;nix. This is supposed to
represent the course of the sun, which commences its growth
at the time of its death. A similar fable is found among the
Swedes. Now a tropical nation would find the difference of
days too little to lead it to invent such a fable to represent it.
It must needs have arisen where the days of winter were
very much shorter than those of summer.</p>

<p>The Book of Zoroaster, in which some of the earliest notices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of astronomy are recorded, states that the length of a summer
day is twice as long as that of winter. This fixes the latitude
in which that book must have been composed, and makes
it 49&deg;. Whence it follows, that to such a place must we look
for the origin of these spheres, and not to Egypt or Chaldea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus speaks of a nation in that part of the
world, whom he calls Hyperboreans, who had a tradition that
their country is the nearest to the moon, on which they
discovered mountains like those on the earth, and that Apollo
comes there once every nineteen years. This period being that
of the metonic cycle of the moon, shows that if this could have
really been discovered by them, they must have had a long
acquaintance with astronomy.</p>

<p>The Babylonian tablets lead us to the belief that astronomy,
and with it the sphere, and the zodiac were introduced by a
nation coming from the East, from the mountains of Elam,
called the Accadians, before 3000 <small>B.C.</small>, and these may have
been the nation to whom the whole is due.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the arguments for the Egyptians, or
Chaldeans being the originators depend solely on the tradition
handed down by many, that one or other are the oldest
people in the world, with the oldest civilization, and they
have long cultivated astronomy. More precise information,
however, seems to render these traditions, to say the least,
doubtful, and certainly incapable of overthrowing the arguments
adduced above.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE ZODIAC.</h3>


<p>The zodiac, as already stated, is the course in the heavens
apparently pursued by the sun in his annual journey through
the stars. Let us consider for a moment, however, the series
of observations and reflections that must have been necessary
to trace this zone as representing such a course.</p>

<p>First, the diurnal motion of the whole heavens from east
to west must have been noticed during the night, and the
fact that certain stars never set, but turn in a circle round a
fixed point. What becomes then, the next question would be,
of those stars that do descend beneath the horizon, since they
rise in the same relative positions as those in which they set.
They could not be thought to be destroyed, but must complete
the part of the circle that is invisible <i>beneath the earth</i>. The
possibility of any stars finding a path beneath the earth must
have led inevitably to the conception of the earth as a body
suspended in the centre with nothing to support it. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
leaving this alone, it would also be concluded that the sun
went with the stars, and was in a certain position among
them, even when both they and it were invisible. The next
observations necessary would be that the zodiacal constellations
visible during the nights of winter were not the same
as those seen in summer, that such and such a group of stars
passed the meridian at midnight at a certain time, and that
six months afterwards the group exactly opposite in the
heavens passed at the same hour. Now since at midnight
the sun will be exactly opposite the meridian, if it continues
uniformly on its course, it will be among that group of stars
that is opposite the group that culminates at midnight,
and so the sign of the zodiac the sun occupies would be
determined.</p>

<p>This method would be checked by comparisons made in
the morning and evening with the constellations visible
nearest to the sun at its rising and setting.</p>

<p>The difficulty and indirectness of these observations would
make it probable that originally the zodiac would be determined
rather by the path of the moon, which follows nearly
the same path as the sun, and which could be observed at the
same time as, and actually associated with, the constellations.
Now the moon is found each night so far to the east of its
position on the previous night that it accomplishes the whole
circumference in twenty-seven days eight hours. The two
nearest whole number of days have generally been reckoned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
some taking twenty-eight, and others twenty-seven. The zodiac,
or, as the Chinese called it, the Yellow Way, was thus divided
into twenty-eight parts, which were called <i>Nakshatras</i> (mansions,
or hotels), because the moon remains in each of them
for a period of twenty-four hours. These mansions were named
after the brightest stars in each, though sometimes they went
a long way off to fix upon a characteristic star, as in the
sixteenth Indian constellation, <i>Vichaca</i>, which was named
after the Northern Crown, in latitude 40&deg;. This arose from
the brightness of the moon extinguishing the light of those
that lie nearest to it.</p>

<p>This method of dividing the zodiac was very widely spread,
and was common to almost all ancient nations. The Chinese
have twenty-eight constellations, but the word <i>siou</i> does not
mean a group of stars, but simply a mansion or hotel. In
the Coptic and ancient Egyptian the word for constellation
has the same meaning. They also had twenty-eight, and
the same number is found among the Arabians, Persians, and
Indians. Among the Chaldeans, or Accadians, we find no
sign of the number twenty-eight. The ecliptic or "Yoke of
the Sky," with them, as we see in the newly-discovered
tablets, was divided into twelve divisions as now, and the
only connection that can be imagined between this and the
twenty-eight is the opinion of M. Biot, who thinks that the
Chinese had originally only twenty-four mansions, four more
being added by Chenkung (<small>B.C.</small> 1100), and that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
corresponded with the twenty-four stars, twelve to the north
and twelve to the south, that marked the twelve signs of
the zodiac among the Chaldeans. But under this supposition
the twenty-eight has no reference to the moon, whereas we
have every reason to believe that it has.</p>

<p>The Siamese only reckoned twenty-seven, and occasionally
inserted an extra one, called <i>Abigitten</i>, or intercalary moon.
They made use, moreover, of the constellations to tell the
hour of the night by their position in the heavens, and their
method of doing this appears to have involved their having
twenty-eight constellations. The names of the twenty-eight
divisions among the Arabs were derived from parts of the
larger constellations that made the twelve signs, the first
being the horns, and the second the belly, of the Ram.</p>

<p>The twenty-eight divisions among the Persians, of which
we may notice that the second was formed by the Pleiades,
and called <i>Pervis</i>, soon gave way to the twelve, the names of
which, recorded in the works of Zoroaster, and therefore not
less ancient than he, were not quite the same as those now
used. They were the Lamb, the Bull, the Twins, the Crab,
the Lion, the Ear of Corn, the Balance, the Scorpion, the Bow,
the Sea-Goat, the Watering-pot, and the Fishes.</p>

<p>Nor were the Chinese continually bound to the number
twenty-eight. They, too, had a zodiac for the sun as well as
the moon, as may be seen on some very curious pieces of
money, of which those figured below are specimens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 670px;">

</div>

<p>On some of these the various constellations of the Northern
hemisphere are engraved, especially the Great Bear&mdash;under
innumerable disguises&mdash;and on others the twelve signs of the
zodiac. These are very different, however, from the Grecian
set&mdash;they are the Mouse, the Bull, the Tiger, the Hare, the
Dragon, the Serpent, the Horse, the Ram, the Monkey, the
Cock, the Dog, and the Pig. The Japanese series were the
same. The Mongolians had a series of zodiacal coins struck
in the reign of Jehanjir Shah (1014). He had pieces of
gold stamped, representing the sun in the constellation of the
Lion; and some years afterwards other coins were made, with
one side having the impress of the particular sign in which
the sun happened to be when the coin was struck. In
this way a series is preserved having all the twelve signs.
Tavernier tells the story that one of the wives of the Sultan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
wishing to immortalise herself, asked Jehanjir to be allowed
to reign for four-and-twenty hours, and took the opportunity
to have a large quantity of new gold and silver zodiacal coins
struck and distributed among the people.</p>

<p>The twenty-eight divisions are less known now, simply
from the fact that the Greeks did not adopt them; but they
were much used by the early Asian peoples, who distinguished
them, like the twelve, by a series of animals, and they are
still used by the Arabs.</p>

<p>So far for the nature of the zodiac, as used in various
countries, and as adopted from more ancient sources by the
Greeks and handed on to us. It is very remarkable that
the arrangement of it, and its relation to the pole of the
equator, carries with it some indication of the age in which
it must have been invented, as we now proceed to show.</p>

<p>We may remark, in the first place, that from very early
times the centre of the zodiacal circle has been marked in
the celestial sphere, though there is no remarkable star near
the spot; and the centre of the equatorial circle, or pole, has
been even less noticed, though much more obvious. We
cannot perhaps conclude that the instability of the pole was
known, but that the necessity for drawing the zodiac led to
attention being paid to its centre. Both the Persians and
the Chinese noted in addition four bright stars, which they
said watched over the rest, <i>Taschter</i> over the east, <i>Sateris</i>
over the west, <i>Venaud</i> over the south, and <i>Hastorang</i> over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the north. Now we must understand these points to refer to
the sun, the east being the spring equinox, the west the
autumnal, and the north and south the summer and winter
solstices. There are no stars of any brilliancy that we could
now suppose referred to in these positions; but if we turn
the zodiac through 60&deg; we shall find Aldebaran, the Antares,
Regulus, and Fomalhaut, four stars of the first magnitude,
pretty nearly in the right places. Does the zodiac then turn
in this way? The answer is, It does.</p>

<p>The effect of the attraction of the sun and moon upon the
equatorial protuberance of the earth is to draw it round from
west to east by a very slow motion, and make the ecliptic
cross the equator each year about one minute of arc to the
east of where it crossed it the year before. So, then, the
sidereal year, or interval between the times at which the sun
is in a certain position amongst the stars, is longer than the
solar year, or interval between the times at which the sun
crosses the equator at the vernal equinox. Now the sun's
position in the zodiac refers to the former, his appearance at
the equinox to the latter kind of year. Each solar year then&mdash;and
these are the years we usually reckon by&mdash;the equinox is
at a point fifty seconds of arc to the east on the zodiac, an
effect which is known by the name of the precession of the
equinoxes.</p>

<p>Now it is plain that if it keeps moving continuously to
the east it will at last come round to the same point again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and the whole period of its revolution can easily be calculated
from the distance it moves each year. The result of such a
calculation shows that the whole revolution is completed in
25,870 years, after which time all will be again as it is now
in this respect.</p>

<p>If we draw a figure of the zodiac, as below, and know
that at this time the vernal equinox takes place when the
sun is in the Fishes, then, the constellation of the Ram being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to the west of this, the date at which the equinox was there
must be before our present date, while at some time in the
future it will be in Aquarius.</p>

<p>Now if in any old description we find that the equinox is
referred to as being in the Ram or in the Bull, it tells us at
once how long ago such a description was a true one, and,
therefore, when it was written. This is the way in which
the Zodiac carries with it an intimation of its date. Thus
in the example lately referred to of the Persians and their
four stars, it must have been about 5,000 years ago, according
to the above calculation, that these were in the positions
assigned, which is therefore the date of this part of Persian
astronomy, if we have rightly conjectured the stars
referred to.</p>

<p>We have already said that the signs of the zodiac are not
now the same as the zodiacal constellations, and this is now
easily understood. It is not worth while to say that the
sun enters such and such a part of the Fishes at the equinox,
and changes every year. So the part of the heavens it <i>does</i>
then enter&mdash;be it Fishes, or Aquarius, or the Ram&mdash;is called
by the same name&mdash;and is called a <i>sign</i>; the name chosen is
the Ram or Aries, which coincided with the constellation of
that name when the matter was arranged. There is another
equally important and instructive result of this precession of
the equinox. For the earth's axis is always perpendicular to
the plane of the equator, and if the latter moves, the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
must too, and change its position with respect to the axis of
the ecliptic, which remains immovable. And the ends of
these axes, or the points they occupy among the stars, called
their poles, will change in the same way; the pole of the
equator, round which the heavens appear to move, describing
a curve about the pole of the ecliptic; and since the ecliptic
and equator are always <i>nearly</i> at the same angle, this curve
will be very nearly a circle, as represented on preceding page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/120.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="Fig. 12." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 12.</span>
</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Now the pole of the equator is a very marked point in
the heavens, because the star nearest to it appears to have
no motion. If then we draw such a figure as above, so as
to see where this pole would be at any given date, and then
read in any old record that such and such a star had no
motion, we know at once at what date such a statement
must have been made. This means of estimating dates is
less certain than the other, because any star that is nearer to
the pole than any other will appear to have no motion
<i>relatively</i> to the rest, unless accurate measurements were
made. Nevertheless, when we have any reason to believe
that observations were carefully made, and there is any
evidence that some particular star was considered the Pole
Star, we have some confidence in concluding the date,
examples of which will appear in the sequel; and we may
give one illustration now, though not a very satisfactory one.
Hipparchus cites a passage from the sphere of Eudoxus, in
which he says, <i>Est vero stella qu&aelig;dam in eodem consistens
loco, qu&aelig; quidem polus est mundi.</i> (There is a certain immovable
star, which is the pole of the world.)</p>

<p>Now referring to our figure, we find that about 1300 <small>B.C.</small>
the two stars, &#946; Urs&aelig; Minoris and &#954; Draconis were fairly
near the pole, and this fact leads us to date the invention of
this sphere at about this epoch, rather than a little before or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a little after, although, of course, there is nothing in <i>this</i>
argument (though there may be in others), to prevent us
dating it when &#945; Draconis was near the pole, 2850 <small>B.C.</small> This
star was indeed said by the Chinese astronomers in the reign
of Hoangti to mark the pole, which gives a date to their
observations. The chief use of this latter method is to
<i>confirm</i> our conclusions from the former, rather than to
originate any. Let us now apply our knowledge to the facts.</p>

<p>In the first place we may notice that in the time of
Hipparchus the vernal equinox was in the first degree of the
Ram, from which our own arrangement has originated.
Hipparchus lived 128 years <small>B.C.</small>, or nearly 2,000 years ago, at
which time the equinox was exactly at &#946; Aries. Secondly, there
are many reasons for believing that at the time of the invention
of the zodiac, indeed in the first dawning of
astronomy, the Bull was the first sign into which the sun
entered at the vernal equinox. Now it takes 2,156 years to
retrograde through a sign, and therefore the Bull might occupy
this position any time between 2400 and 4456 <small>B.C.</small>, and any
nearer approximation must depend on our ability to fix
on any particular <i>part</i> of the constellation as the original
equinoctial point. We may say that whoever invented the
zodiac would no doubt make this point the <i>beginning</i> of a
sign, and therefore date its invention 2400 <small>B.C.</small>; or on the
other hand, if it can be proved that the constellations were
known and observed before this, we may have to put back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the date to near the end of the sign, and make its last
remarkable stars the equinoctial ones, say those in the
horns of Taurus. Compare the line of Virgil,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"Candidus auratis aperit cum cornibus annum<br />
Taurus."<br />
</p></div>

<p>The date in this case would be about 4500 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;or once
more some remarkable part of the constellation may give
proof that its appearance with the sun commenced the year&mdash;and
our date would be intermediate between these two.
In fact, the remarkable group of stars known as the <i>Pleiades</i>
actually does play this part. So much interest clusters, however,
round this group, so much light is thrown by it on the
past history of astronomical ideas&mdash;and so much new information
has recently been obtained about it&mdash;that it requires
a chapter to itself, and we shall therefore pass over its
discussion here. Let us now review some of the indications
that some part of the constellation of the Bull was originally
the first sign of the zodiac.</p>

<p>We need perhaps only mention the astrological books of
the Jews&mdash;the Cabal&mdash;in which the Bull is dealt with as the
first zodiacal sign. Among the Persians, who designate the
successive signs by the letters of the alphabet, <i>A</i> stands
for Taurus, <i>B</i> for the Twins, and so on. The Chinese attribute
the commencement of the sun's apparent motion to the
stars of Taurus. In Thebes is a sepulchral chamber with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
zodiacal signs, and Taurus at the head of them. The zodiac
of the pagoda of Elephanta (Salsette) commences with the
same constellation.</p>

<p>However, reasons have been given for assigning to the
zodiac a still earlier date than this would involve. Thus
Laplace writes:&mdash;"The names of the constellations of the
zodiac have not been given to them by chance&mdash;they embody
the results of a large number of researches and of astronomical
systems. Some of the names appear to have
reference to the motion of the sun. The Crab, for instance,
and the He-Goat, indicate its retrogression at the solstices.
The Balance marks the equality of the days and nights at
the equinoxes, and the other names seem to refer to agriculture
and to the climate of the country in which the zodiac
was invented. The He-Goat appears better placed at the
highest point of the sun's course than the lowest. In this
position, which it occupied fifteen thousand years ago, the
Balance was at the vernal equinox, and the zodiacal constellations
match well with the climate and agriculture of
Egypt." If we examine this, however, we see that all that
is probable in it is satisfied by the Ram being at the vernal,
and the Balance at the autumnal equinox, which corresponds
much better with other evidence.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/125.jpg" width="700" height="680" alt="The Zodiac of Denderah." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Zodiac of Denderah.</span>
</div>

<p>In the first instance, no doubt, the names of the zodiacal
constellations would depend on the principal star or stars in
each, and these stars and the portion of the ecliptic assigned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to each may have been noticed before the stars round them
were grouped into constellations with different names. In
any case, the introduction of the zodiac into Greece seems
to have been subsequent to that of the celestial sphere,
and not to have taken place more than five or six centuries
before our era. Eudemus, of Rhodes, one of the most distinguished
of the pupils of Aristotle, and author of a History
of Astronomy, attributes the introduction of the zodiac to
&#338;nopides of Chio, a contemporary of Anaxagoras. They
did not receive it complete, as at first it had only eleven
constellations, one of them, the Scorpion, being afterwards
divided, to complete the necessary number. Their zodiacal
divisions too would have been more regular had they derived
them directly from the East, and would not have stretched in
some instances over 36&deg; to 48&deg;, like the Lion, the Bull, the
Fishes, or the Virgin&mdash;while the Crab, the Ram, and the He-Goat,
have only 19&deg; to 23&deg;. Nor would their constellations be
disposed so irregularly, some to the north and some to the
south of the ecliptic, nor some spreading out widely and
others crammed close together, so that we see that they only
borrowed the idea from the Easterns, and filled it out with their
ancient constellations. Such is the opinion of Humboldt.</p>

<p>With regard to the origin of the names of the signs of the
zodiac, we must remember that a certain portion of the
zodiacal circle, and not any definite group of stars, forms
each sign, and that the constellations may have been formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
separately, and have received independent names, though
afterwards receiving those of the sign in which they were.
The only rational suggestion for the origin of the names is
that they were connected with some events which took place,
or some character of the sun's motion observed, when it was
in each sign. Thus we have seen that the Balance may refer
to equal nights and days (though only introduced among
the <i>Greeks</i> in the time of Hipparchus), and the Crab to the
retrogression or stopping of the sun at the solstice.</p>

<p>The various pursuits of husbandry, having all their
necessary times, which in the primeval days were determined
by the positions of the stars, would give rise to more
important names. Thus the Ethiopian, at Thebes, would call
the stars that by their rising at a particular time indicated
the inundation, Aquarius, or the Waterer; those beneath
which it was necessary to put the plough to the earth, the
Bull stars. The Lion stars would be those at whose appearance
this formidable animal, driven from the deserts by
thirst, showed himself on the borders of the river. Those
of the Ear of Corn, or the Virgin of harvest, those beneath
which the harvest was to be gathered in; and the sign of
the Goat, that in which the sun was when these animals
were born.</p>

<p>There can be but little doubt but that such was the origin
of the names imposed, and for a time they would be understood
in that sense. But afterwards, when time was more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
accurately kept, and calendars regulated, without each man
studying the stars for himself, when the precession of the
equinoxes made the periods not exactly coincide, the
original meaning would be lost, the stars would be associated
with the animals, as though there was a real bull, a real lion,
&amp;c., in the heavens; and then the step would be easy to
represent these by living animals, whom they would endow
with the heavenly attributes of what they represented; and
so the people came at last to pray to and worship the several
creatures for the sake of their supposed influence. They
asked of the Ram from their flocks the influences they
thought depended on the constellation. They prayed the
Scorpion not to spread his evil venom on the world; they
revered the Crab, the Scarab&aelig;us, and the Fish, without
perceiving the absurdity of it.</p>

<p>It is certain at least that the gods of many nations are
connected or are identical with the signs of the zodiac, and
it seems at least more reasonable to suppose the former
derived from the latter than <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks indeed, who had, so to speak, their
gods ready made before they borrowed the idea of the zodiac,
the process appears to have been the reverse, they made the
signs to represent as far as they could their gods. In the
more pastoral peoples, however, of the East, and in Egypt, this
process can be very clearly traced. Among the Jews there
seems to be some remarkable connection between their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
patriarchs and these signs, though the history of that connection
may not well be made out. The twelve signs are
mentioned as being worshipped, along with the sun and
moon, in the Book of Kings. But what is more remarkable
is the dream of Joseph, in which the sun and moon and the
other eleven stars worshipped him, coupled with the various
designations or descriptions given to each son in the blessing
of Jacob. In Reuben we have the man who is said to be
"unstable as water," in which we may recognise Aquarius.
In Simeon and Levi "the brethren," we trace the Twins.
Judah is the "Lion." Zebulun, "that dwells at the haven
of the sea," represents Fishes. Issachar is the Bull, or
"strong ass couching down between two burdens." Dan,
"the serpent by the way, the adder in the path," represents
the Scorpion. Gad is the Ram, the leader to a flock or
troop of sheep. Asher the Balance, as the weigher of
bread. Naphtali, "the hind let loose," is the Capricorn,
Joseph the Archer, whose bow abode in strength. Brujanin
the Crab, changing from morning to evening, and
Dinah, the only daughter, represents the Virgin.</p>

<p>There is doubtless something far-fetched in some of these
comparisons, but when we consider the care with which the
number twelve was retained, and that the four chief tribes
carried on their sacred standards these very signs&mdash;namely,
Judah a lion, Reuben a man, Ephraim a bull, and Dan a scorpion&mdash;and
notice the numerous traces of astronomical culture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in the Jewish ceremonies, the seven lights of the candlestick,
the twelve stones of the High Priest, the feasts at the two
equinoxes, the ceremonies connected with a ram and a bull,
we cannot doubt that there is something more than chance in
the matter, but rather conclude that we have an example of
the process by which, in the hands of the Egyptians themselves,
astronomical representations became at last actually
deified.</p>

<p>It has been thought possible indeed to assign definitely
each god of the Egyptians to one of the twelve zodiacal
signs. The Ram was consecrated to Jupiter Ammon, who
was represented with a ram's head and horns. The Bull
became the god Apis, who was worshipped under that
similitude. The Twins correspond to Horus and Harpocrates,
two sons of Osiris. The Crab was consecrated to Anubis
or Mercury. The Lion belonged to the summer sun, Osiris;
the Virgin to Isis. The Balance and the Scorpion were
included together under the name of Scorpion, which animal
belongs to Typhon, as did all dangerous animals. The Archer
was the image of Hercules, for whom the Egyptians had
great veneration. The Capricorn was consecrated to Pan
or Mendes. The Waterer&mdash;or man carrying a water-pot&mdash;is
found on many Egyptian monuments.</p>

<p>This process of deification was rendered easier by the
custom they had of celebrating a festival each month, under
the name <i>neomenia</i>. They characterised the neomenias of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the various months by making the animal whose sign the
sun was entering accompany the Isis which announced
the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>. They were not content with a representation only,
but had the animal itself. The dog, being the symbol of
Cannulus, with which the year commenced, a living dog
was made to head the ceremonial of the first neomenia.
Diodorus testifies to this as an eye-witness.</p>

<p>These neomenias thus came to be called the festival of
the Bull, of the Ram, the Dog, or the Lion. That of the
Ram would be the most solemn and important in places
where they dealt much in sheep. That of the Bull in the
fat pasture-lands of Memphis and Lower Egypt. That of
Capella would be brilliant at Mendes, where they bred goats
more than elsewhere.</p>

<p>We may fortify these opinions by a quotation from Lucian,
who gives expression to them very clearly. "It is from the
divisions of the zodiac," he says, "that the crowd of animals
worshipped in Egypt have had their origin. Some employed
one constellation, and some another. Those who used to
consult that of the Ram came to adore a ram. Those who
took their presages from the Fishes would not eat fish. The
goat was not killed in places were they observed Capricornus,
and so on, according to the stars whose influence they cared
most for. If they adored a bull it was certainly to do
honour to the celestial Bull. The Apis, which was a sacred
object with them, and wandered at liberty through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
country, and for which they founded an oracle, was the
astrological symbol of the Bull that shone in the heavens."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<p>Their use of the zodiac is illustrated in an interesting
manner by a mummy found some years ago in Egypt. At
the bottom of the coffin was found painted a zodiac, something
like that of Denderah; underneath the lid, along the
body of a great goddess, were drawn eleven signs, but with
that of <i>Capricornus</i> left out. The inscription showed that
the mummy was that of a young man, aged 21 years,
4 months, and 22 days, who died the 19th year of Trajan,
on the 8th of the month Pazni, which corresponds to the
2nd of June, <small>A.D.</small> 116. The embalmed was therefore born
on the 12th of January, <small>A.D.</small> 95, at which time the sun was
in the constellation of Capricornus. This shows that the
zodiac was the representation of the astrological theories
about the person embalmed, who was doubtless a person
of some importance. (See Plate IV.) Any such use as this,
however, must have been long subsequent to the invention
of the signs themselves, as it involves a much more complicated
idea.</p>

<h3>THE PLEIADES.</h3>


<p>Among the most remarkable of the constellations is a group
of seven stars arranged in a kind of triangular cluster, and
known as the Pleiades. It is not, strictly speaking, one of
the constellations, as it forms only part of one. We have
seen that one of the ancient signs of the zodiac is the Bull,
or Taurus; the group of stars we are now speaking of forms
part of this, lying towards the eastern part in the shoulders
of the Bull. The Pleiades scarcely escape anybody's observation
now, and we shall not be, therefore, surprised that
they have always attracted great attention. So great indeed
has been the attention paid to them that festivals and seasons,
calendars and years, have by many nations been regulated by
their rising or culmination, and they have been thus more
mixed up with the early history of astronomy, and have left
more marks on the records of past nations, than any other
celestial object, except the sun and moon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The interesting details of the history of the Pleiades have
been very carefully worked out by R. G. Haliburton, F.S.A.,
to whom we owe the greater part of the information we
possess on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Mr. Haliburton's observations are contained in an interesting pamphlet,
entitled <i>New Materials for the History of Man</i>, which is quoted by Prof.
Piazzi Smyth, but which is not easy to obtain. It may be seen, however, in
the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>Let us first explain what may be observed with respect to
the Pleiades. It is a group possessing peculiar advantages
for observation; it is a compact group, the whole will appear
at once; and it is an unmistakable group and it is near the
equator, and is therefore visible to observers in either
hemisphere.</p>

<p>Now suppose the sun to be in the same latitude as the
Pleiades on some particular day; owing to the proximity of the
group to the ecliptic, it will be then very near the sun, and it
will set with it and be invisible during the night. If the sun
were to the east of the Pleiades they would have already set,
and the first view of the heavens at sunset would not contain
this constellation; and so it would be so long as the sun
was to the east, or for nearly half a year; though during some
portion of this time it would rise later on in the night.
During the other half year, while the sun was to the west,
the Pleiades would be visible at sunset, and we immediately
see how they are thus led to divide the whole year into two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
portions, one of which might be called <i>the Pleiades below</i>, and
the other <i>the Pleiades above</i>. It is plain that the Pleiades
first become visible at sunset, when they are then just rising,
in which case they will culminate a little after midnight (not
at midnight, on account of the twilight) and be visible all
night. This will occur when the sun is about half a circle
removed from them&mdash;that is, at this time, about the beginning
of November; which would thus be the commencement of
one half of the year, the other half commencing in May. The
culmination of the Pleiades at midnight takes place a few
days later, when they rise at the time that the sun is really
on the horizon, in which case they are exactly opposite to it;
and this will happen on the same day all over the earth. The
opposite effect to this would be when the sun was close to
the Pleiades&mdash;a few days before which the latter would be
just setting after sunset, and a few days after would be
just rising before sunrise.</p>

<p>We have thus the following observations, that might be
made with respect to this, or any other well-marked constellation.
First, the period during which it was visible at
sunset; secondly, the date of its culmination at midnight;
thirdly, its setting in the evening; and fourthly, its rising
in the morning: the last two dates being nearly six months
removed from the second. There are also the dates of its
culmination at sunrise and sunset, which would divide these
intervals into two equal halves. On account of the preces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>sion
of the equinoxes, as explained in the last chapter, the
time at which the sun has any particular position with
respect to the stars, grows later year by year in relation to
the equinoctial points. And as we regulate our year by the
date of the sun's entrance on the northern hemisphere, the
sidereal dates, as we may call them, keep advancing on the
months. As, however, the change is slow, it has not prevented
years being commenced and husbandry being regulated
by the dates above mentioned. Any date that is
regulated by the stars we might expect to be nearly the
same all over the world, and the customs observed to be
universal, though the date itself might alter, and in this
way. So long as the date was directly obtained from the
position of the star, all would agree; but as soon as a solar
calendar was arranged, and it was found that at that time
this position coincided with a certain day, say the Pleiades
culminating at midnight on November 17, then some would
keep on the date November 17 as the important day, even
when the Pleiades no longer culminated at midnight then,
and others would keep reckoning by the stars, and so have
a different date.</p>

<p>With these explanations we shall be able to recognise
how much the configurations of the Pleiades have had to do
with the festivals and calendars of nations, and have even
left their traces on customs and names in use among ourselves
to the present day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>We have evidences from two very different quarters of the
universality of the division of the year into two parts by
means of the Pleiades. On the one hand we learn from
Hesiod that the Greeks commenced their winter seasons in
his days by the setting of the Pleiades in the morning, and
the summer season by their rising at that time. And Mr.
Ellis, in his <i>Polynesian Researches</i>, tells us that "the Society
Islanders divided the year into two seasons of the Pleiades,
or <i>Matarii</i>. The first they called <i>Matarii i nia</i>, or the
<i>Pleiades above</i>. It commenced when, in the evening, these
stars appeared at or near the horizon, and the half year
during which, immediately after sunset, they were seen above
the horizon was called <i>Matarii i nia</i>. The other season
commenced when at sunset these stars are invisible, and
continued until at that time they appeared again above the
horizon. This season was called <i>Matarii i raro</i>, i.e. <i>the
Pleiades below</i>." Besides these direct evidences we shall
find that many semi-annual festivals connected with these
stars indicate the commencement of the two seasons among
other nations.</p>

<p>One of these festivals was of course always taken for the
commencement of the year, and much was made of it as
new-year's day. A new-year's festival connected with and
determined by the Pleiades appears to be one of the most
universal of all customs; and though some little difficulty
arises, as we have already pointed out, in fixing the date with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
reference to solar calendars, and differences and coincidences
in this respect among different nations may be to a certain
extent accidental, yet the fact of the wide-spread observance
of such a festival is certain and most interesting.</p>

<p>The actual observance at the present day of this festival
is to be found among the Australian savages. At their
midnight culmination in November, they still hold a new-year's
<i>corroboree</i>, in honour of the <i>Mormodellick</i>, as they
call the Pleiades, which they say are "very good to the
black fellows." With them November is somewhat after the
beginning of spring, but in former days it would mark the
actual commencement, and the new year would be regulated
by the seasons.</p>

<p>In the northern hemisphere this culmination of the Pleiades
has the same relation to the autumnal equinox, which would
never be taken as the commencement of the year; and we
must therefore look to the southern hemisphere for the origin
of the custom; especially as we find the very Pleiades themselves
called <i>Vergili&aelig;</i>, or stars of spring. Of course we might
suppose that the rising of the constellation in the <i>morning</i>
had been observed in the northern hemisphere, which would
certainly have taken place in the beginning of spring some
5,000 years ago; but this seems improbable, first, because it
is unlikely that different phenomena of the Pleiades should
have been most noticed, and secondly, because neither April
nor May are among any nations connected with this constel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>lation
by name. Whereas in India the year commenced in
the month they called <i>Cartiguey</i>, which means the Pleiades.
Among the ancient Egyptians we find the same connection
between <i>Athar-aye</i>, the name of the Pleiades, with the
Chaldeans and Hebrews, and <i>Athor</i> in the Egyptian
name of November. The Arabs also call the constellation
<i>Atauria</i>. We shall have more to say on this etymology
presently, but in the meantime we learn that it was the
phenomenon connected with the Pleiades at or about
November that was noticed by all ancient nations, from
which we must conclude that the origin of the new-year's
spring festival came from the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>There is some corroboration of this in the ancient traditions
as to the stars having changed their courses. In the
southern hemisphere a man standing facing the position of
the sun at noon would see the stars rise on his right hand
and move towards his left. In the northern hemisphere, if
he also looked in the direction of the sun at noon, he would
see them rise on his left hand. Now one of a race migrating
from one side to the other of the equator would take his
position from the sun, and fancy he was facing the same way
when he looked at it at noon, and so would think the
motion of the stars to have altered, instead of his having
turned round. Such a tradition, then, seems to have arisen
from such a migration, the fact of which seems to be confirmed
by the calling the Pleiades stars of spring, and commencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the year with their culmination at midnight. In order to
trace this new-year's festival into other countries, and by this
means to show its connection with the Pleiades, we must
remark that every festival has its peculiar features and rites,
and it is by these that we must recognise it, where the actual
date of its occurrence has slightly changed; bearing, of course,
in mind that the actual change of date must not be too great
to be accounted for by the precession of the equinoxes, or about
seventy-one years for each day of change, since the institution
of the festival, and that the change is in the right direction.</p>

<p>Now we find that everywhere this festival of the Pleiades'
culmination at midnight (or it may be of the slightly earlier
one of their first appearance at the horizon at apparent sunset)
was always connected with the memory of the dead. It was
a "feast of ancestors."</p>

<p>Among the Australians themselves, the <i>corroborees</i> of the
natives are connected with a worship of the dead. They paint
a white stripe over their arms, legs, and ribs, and, dancing by
the light of their fires by night, appear like so many skeletons
rejoicing. What is also to be remarked, the festival lasts
three days, and commences in the evening; the latter a
natural result of the date depending on the appearance of
the Pleiades on the horizon at that time.</p>

<p>The Society Islanders, who, as we have seen, divided
their year by the appearance of the Pleiades at sunset, commenced
their year on the first day of the appearance, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
November, and also celebrated the closing of one and the
opening of a new year by a "usage resembling much the
popish custom of mass for souls in purgatory," each man
returning to his home to offer special prayers for the
spirits of departed relatives.</p>

<p>In the Tonga Islands, which belong to the Fiji group, the
festival of <i>Inachi</i>, a vernal first-fruits' celebration, and also
a commemoration of the dead takes place towards the end
of October, and commences at sunset.</p>

<p>In Peru the new-year's festival occurs in the beginning of
November, and is "called <i>Ayamarca</i> from <i>aya</i>, a corpse,
and <i>marca</i>, carrying in arms, because they celebrated the solemn
festival of the dead, with tears, lugubrious songs, and plaintive
music; and it was customary to visit the tombs of
relations, and to leave in them food and drink." The fact that
this took place at the time of the discovery of Peru on the
very same day as a similar ceremony takes place in Europe,
was only an accidental coincidence, which is all the more
remarkable because the two appear, as will be seen in the
sequel, to have had the same origin, and therefore at first the
same date, and to have altered from it by exactly the same
amount. These instances from races south of the equator
prove clearly that there exists a very general connection with
new-year's day, as determined by the rising of the Pleiades
at sunset, and a festival of the dead; and in some instances
with an offering of first-fruits.  What the origin of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
connection may be is a more difficult matter. At first sight
one might conjecture that with the year that was passed it
was natural to connect the men that had passed away; and
this may indeed be the true interpretation: but there are
traditions and observances which may be thought by some to
point to some ancient wide-spread catastrophe which happened
at this particular season, which they yearly commemorated,
and reckoned a new year from each commemoration. Such
traditions and observances we shall notice as we trace the
spread of this new-year's festival of the dead among various
nations, and its connection, with the Pleiades.</p>

<p>We have seen that in India November is called the month
of the Pleiades. Now on the 17th day of that month is
celebrated the Hindoo Durga, a festival of the dead, and said
by Greswell to have been a new-year's commemoration at the
earliest time to which Indian calendars can be carried back.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Egyptians the same day was very
noticeable, and they took care to regulate their solar calendars
that it might remain unchanged. Numerous altered calendars
have been discovered, but they are all regulated by this one
day. This was determined by the culmination of the Pleiades
at midnight. On this day commenced the solemn festival of
the Isia, which, like the <i>corroborees</i> of the Australians, lasted
three days, and was celebrated in honour of the dead, and
of Osiris, the lord of tombs. Now the month Athyr was undoubtedly
connected with the Pleiades, being that "in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the Pleiades are most distinct"&mdash;that is, in which they rise
near and before sunset. Among the Egyptians, however,
more attention was paid to astronomy than amongst the
savage races with which the year of the Pleiades would
appear to have originated, and they studied very carefully
the connection between the positions of the stars and the
entrance of the sun into the northern hemisphere, and
regulated their calendar accordingly; as we shall see shortly
in speaking of the pyramid builders.</p>

<p>The Persians formerly called the month of November
<i>Mord&acirc;d</i>, the angel of death, and the feast of the dead
took place at the same time as in Peru, and was considered
a new-year's festival. It commenced also in the evening.</p>

<p>In Ceylon a combined festival of agriculture and of the
dead takes place at the beginning of November.</p>

<p>Among the better known of the ancient nations of the
northern hemispheres, such as the Greeks and Romans,
the anomaly of having the beginning of the year at the
autumnal equinox seems to have induced them to make a
change to that of spring, and with this change has followed
the festival of the dead, although some traces of it were left
in November.</p>

<p>The commemoration of the dead was connected among the
Egyptians with a deluge, which was typified by the priest
placing the image of Osiris in a sacred coffer or ark, and
launching it out into the sea till it was borne out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Now when we connect this fact, and the celebration taking
place on the 17th day of Athyr, with the date on which the
Mosaic account of the deluge of Noah states it to have commenced,
"in the second month (of the Jewish year, which
corresponds to November), the 17th day of the month," it must
be acknowledged that this is no chance coincidence, and that
the precise date here stated must have been regulated by the
Pleiades, as was the Egyptian date. This coincidence is
rendered even stronger by the similiarity of traditions among
the two nations concerning the dove and the tree as connected
with the deluge. We find, however, no festival of the dead
among the Hebrews; their better form of faith having
prevented it.</p>

<p>We have not as yet learnt anything of the importance of
the Pleiades among the ancient Babylonian astronomers, but
as through their tablets we have lately become acquainted
with their version of the story of the deluge, we may be led
in this way to further information about their astronomical
appreciation of this constellation.</p>

<p>From whatever source derived, it is certain that the Celtic
races were partakers in this general culture, we might almost
call it, of the Pleiades, as shown by the time and character
of their festival of the dead. This is especially interesting to
ourselves, as it points to the origin of the superstitions of
the Druids, and accounts for customs remaining even to
this day amongst us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of November was with the Druids a night full of
mystery, in which they annually celebrated the reconstruction
of the world. A terrible rite was connected with this;
for the Druidess nuns were obliged at this time to pull down
and rebuild each year the roof of their temple, as a symbol
of the destruction and renovation of the world. If one of
them, in bringing the materials for the new roof, let fall her
sacred burden, she was lost. Her companions, seized with a
fanatic transport, rushed upon her and tore her to pieces, and
scarcely a year is said to have passed without there being one
or more victims. On this same night the Druids extinguished
the sacred fire, which was kept continually burning in the
sacred precincts, and at that signal all the fires in the island
were one by one put out, and a primitive night reigned
throughout the land. Then passed along to the west the
phantoms of those who had died during the preceding year,
and were carried away by boats to the judgment-seat of the god
of the dead. (Plate V.) Although Druidism is now extinct,
the relics of it remain to this day, for in our calendar we still
find November 1 marked as All Saints' Day, and in the pre-Reformation
calendars the last day of October was marked
All Hallow Eve, and the 2nd of November as All Souls';
indicating clearly a three days' festival of the dead, commencing
in the evening, and originally regulated by the Pleiades&mdash;an
emphatic testimony how much astronomy has been
mixed up with the rites and customs even of the English of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to-day. In former days the relics were more numerous, in
the Hallowe'en torches of the Irish, the bonfires of the
Scotch, the <i>coel-coeth</i> fires of the Welsh, and the <i>tindle</i> fires
of Cornwall, all lighted on Hallowe'en. In France it still
lingers more than here, for to this very day the Parisians at
this festival repair to the cemeteries, and lunch at the graves
of their ancestors.</p>

<p>If the extreme antiquity of a rite can be gathered from the
remoteness of the races that still perform it, the fact related
to us by Prescott in his <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>
cannot fail to have great interest. There we find that the
great festival of the Mexican cycle was held in November, at
the time of the midnight culmination of the Pleiades. It
began at sunset, and at midnight as that constellation
approached the zenith, a human victim, was offered up, to
avert the dread calamity which they believed impended over
the human race. They had a tradition that the world had
been previously destroyed at this time, and they were filled
with gloom and dismay, and were not at rest until the Pleiades
were seen to culminate, and a new cycle had begun; this great
cycle, however, was only accomplished in fifty-two years.</p>

<p>It is possible that the festival of lanthorns among the
Japanese, which is celebrated about November, may be also
connected with this same day, as it is certain that that
nation does reckon days by the Pleiades.</p>

<p>These instances of a similar festival at approximately the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
same period of the year, and regulated (until fixed to a
particular day in a solar calendar) by the midnight culmination
of the Pleiades, show conclusively how great an influence
that constellation has had on the manners and customs of the
world, and throw some light on the history of man.</p>

<p>Even where we find no festival connected with the particular
position of the Pleiades which is the basis of the above, they
still are used for the regulation of the seasons&mdash;as amongst
the Dyaks of Borneo. This race of men are guided in their
farming operations by this constellation. "When it is low in
the east at early morning, before sunrise, the elders know it
is time to cut down the jungle; when it approaches mid-heaven,
then it is time to burn what they have cut down;
when it is declining towards the west, then they plant; and
when in the early evening it is seen thus declining, then they
may reap in safety and in peace;" the latter period is also
that of their feast of <i>Nycapian</i>, or first-fruits.</p>

<p>We find the same regulations amongst the ancient Greeks
in the days of Hesiod, who tells us that the corn is to be cut
when the Pleiades rise, and ploughing is to be done when they
set. Also that they are invisible for forty days, and reappear
again at harvest. When the Pleiades rise, the care of the vine
must cease; and when, fleeing from Orion, they are lost in the
waves, sailing commences to be dangerous. The name, indeed,
by which we now know these stars is supposed to be derived
from the word &#960;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, to sail&mdash;because sailing was safe after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
they had risen; though others derive it from &#960;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#953;, a
flight of doves.</p>

<p>Any year that is regulated by the Pleiades, or by any other
group of stars, must, as we have seen before, be what is
called a sidereal, and not a solar year. Now a year in uncivilised
countries can only mean a succession of seasons, as
is illustrated by the use of the expression "a person of so
many summers." It is difficult of course to say when any
particular season begins by noticing its characteristics as to
weather; even the most regular phenomena are not certain
enough for that; we cannot say that when the days and nights
become exactly equal any marked change takes place in the
temperature or humidity of the atmosphere, or in any other
easily-noticed phenomena. The day therefore on which
spring commences is arbitrary, except that, inasmuch as
spring depends on the position of the sun, its commencement,
ought to be regulated by that luminary, and not by some star-group
which has no influence in the matter. Nevertheless
the position of such a group is much more easily observed,
and in early ages could almost alone be observed; and so
long as the midnight culmination of the Pleiades&mdash;judged of,
it must be noticed, by their appearance <i>on the horizon</i> at sunset&mdash;fairly
coincided with that state of weather which might
be reckoned the commencement of spring conditions, no
error would be detected, because the change in their position
is so slow. The solar spring is probably a later discovery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which now, from its greater reasonableness and constancy,
has superseded the old one. But since the time of the sun's
crossing the equator is the natural commencement of spring,
whether discovered or not, it is plain that no group of stars
could be taken as a guide instead, if their indication did not
approximately coincide with this.</p>

<p>If then we can determine the exact date at which the
Pleiades indicated by their midnight culmination the sun's
passage across the equator, we can be sure that the spring
could only have been regulated by this during, say, a thousand
years at most, on either side of this date. It is very certain
that if the method of reckoning spring by the stars had
been invented at a more remote date, some other set of stars
would have been chosen instead.</p>

<p>Now when was this date? It is a matter admitting of
certain calculation, depending only on numbers derived from
observation in our own days and records of the past few
centuries, and the answer is that this date is about 2170 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>We have seen that, though it was probably brought from
the southern hemisphere, the Egyptians adopted the year of
the Pleiades, and celebrated the new-year's festival of the
dead; but they were also advanced astronomers, and would
soon find out the change that took place in the seasons when
regulated by the stars. And to such persons the date at which
the two periods coincided, or at least were exactly half a year
apart, would be one of great importance and interest, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
there seems to be evidence that they did commemorate it in
a very remarkable manner. The evidence, however, is all
circumstantial, and the conclusion therefore can only claim
probability. The evidence is as follows:&mdash;The most remarkable
buildings of Egypt are the pyramids. These are of
various sizes and importance, but are built very much after
the same plan. They seem, however, to be all copies from
one, the largest, namely, the Pyramid of Gizeh, and to be of
subsequent date to this. Their object has long been a puzzle,
and the best conclusion has been supposed to be that they
were for sepulchral purposes, as in some of them coffins
have been found. The large one, however, shows far more
than the rest of the structure, and cannot have been meant
for a funeral pile alone.</p>

<p>Its peculiarities come out on a careful examination and
measurement such as it has been subjected to at the devoted
hands of Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland.
He has shown that it is not built at random, as a tomb might
be, but it is adjusted with exquisite design, and with surprising
accuracy. In the first place it lies due north, south, east,
and west, and the careful ascertainment of the meridian of the
place, by modern astronomical instruments, could not suggest
any improvement in its position in this respect. The outside
of it is now, so to speak, pealed, that is to say, there was
originally, covering the whole, another layer of stones which
have been taken away. These stones, which were of a dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ferent
material, were beautifully polished, as some of the
remaining ones, now covered and concealed, can testify. The
angle at which they are cut, and which of course gives the
angle and elevation of the whole pyramid, is such that the
height of it is in the same proportion to its circumference or
perimeter, as the radius of a circle is to its circumference
approximately. The height, in fact, is proved by measurement
and observation to be 486 ft., and the four sides together to be
3,056 ft., or about 6<small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>7</sub></small> times the height. It does not seem improbable
that, considering their advancement, the Egyptians
might have calculated approximately how much larger the
circumference of the circle is than its diameter, and it is a
curious coincidence that the pyramid expresses it. Professor
Piazzi Smyth goes much further and believes that they knew,
or were divinely taught, the shape and size of the earth, and
by a little manipulation of the length of their unit, or as he
expresses it the "pyramid inch," he makes the base of the
pyramid express the number of miles in the diameter of the
earth.</p>

<p>Now in the interior of the apparently solid structure,
besides the usual slanting passage down to a kind of cellar or
vault beneath the middle of the base, which may have been
used for a sepulchral resting-place, there are two slanting
passages, one running north and the other running south, and
slanting up at different angles. Part of that which leads
south is much enlarged, and is known as the grand gallery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
It is of a very remarkable shape, being perfectly smooth and
polished along its ascending base, as indeed it is in every
part, and having a number of steps or projections, pointing
also upwards at certain angles, very carefully maintained.
Whether we understand its use or not, it is very plain that
it has been made with a very particular design, and one
not easily comprehended. This leads into a chamber
known as the king's chamber, whose walls are exquisitely
polished and which contains a coffer known as <i>Cheops' Coffin</i>.
This coffer has been villainously treated by travellers, who
have chipped and damaged it, but originally it was very
carefully made and polished. It is too large to have been
brought in by the only entrance into the chamber after it was
finished, and therefore is obviously no coffin at all, as is proved
also by the elaborateness of the means of approach. Professor
Piazzi Smyth has made the happy suggestion that it represents
their standard of length and capacity, and points out the
remarkable fact that it contains exactly as much as four
quarters of our dry measure. As no one has ever suggested
what our "quarters" are quarters of, Professor Smyth very
naturally supplies the answer&mdash;"of the contents of the
pyramid coffer." There are various other measurements that
have been made by the same worker, and their meaning suggested
in his interesting book, <i>Our Inheritance in the Great
Pyramid</i>, which we may follow or agree to as we can; but
from all that has been said above, it will appear probable that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
this pyramid was built with a definite design to mark various
natural phenomena or artificial measures, which is all we
require for our present purpose. Now we come to the question,
what is the meaning of the particular angles at which the
north-looking and south-looking passages rise, if, as we now
believe, they must have <i>some</i> meaning.</p>

<p>The exits of these passages were closed, and they could not
therefore have been for observation, but they may have been
so arranged as to be a memorial of any remarkable phenomena
to be seen in those directions. To ascertain if there be any
such to which they point, we must throw back the heavens
to their position in the days of the Egyptians, because, as we
have seen, the precession of the equinoxes alters the meridian
altitude of every star. As the passages point north and
south, if they refer to any star at all, it must be to their
passing the meridian.</p>

<p>Now let us take the heavens as they were 2170 <small>B.C.</small>, the
date at which the Pleiades <i>really</i> commenced the spring, by
their midnight culmination, and ask how high they would be
then. The answer of astronomy is remarkable&mdash;"<i>Exactly at
that height that they could be seen in the direction of the southward-pointing
passage of the pyramid.</i>" And would any star
then be in a position to be seen in the direction of the
other or northward-looking passage? Yes, the largest star
in the constellation of the Dragon, which would be so near
the pole (3&deg; 52&acute;) as to be taken as the Pole Star in those days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
These are such remarkable coincidences in a structure
admittedly made with mathematical accuracy and design,
and truly executed, that we cannot take them to be accidental,
but must endeavour to account for them.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation seems to be, that everything in
the pyramid is intended to represent some standard or
measure, and that these passages have to do with their year.
They had received the year of the Pleiades from a remoter
antiquity than their own, they had discovered the true commencement
of solar spring, as determined from the solar
autumnal equinox, and they commemorated by the building
of the pyramid the coincidence of the two dates, making
passages in it which would have no meaning except at that
particular time.</p>

<p>Whether the pyramid was built <i>at that time</i>, or whether
their astronomical knowledge was sufficient to enable them
to predict it and build accordingly, just as we calculate back
to it, we have no means of knowing. It is very possible that
the pyramid may have been built by some immigrating race
more learned in astronomy, like the Accadians among the
Babylonians.</p>

<p>Either the whole of the conclusions respecting the pyramid
is founded on pure imagination and the whole work upon it
thrown away, or we have here another very remarkable proof
of the influence of the Pleiades on the reckoning of the year,
and a very interesting chapter in the history of the heavens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the guidance of Mr. Haliburton, we shall find
still more customs, and names depending in all probability
on the influence the Pleiades once exerted, and the
observances connected with the feasts in their honour.</p>

<p>The name by which the Pleiades are known among the
Polynesians is the "Tau," which means a season, and they
speak of the years of the Tau, that is of the Pleiades. Now
we have seen that the Egyptians had similar feasts at similar
times, in relation to this constellation, and argued that they
did not arise independently. This seems still further proved
by their name for these stars&mdash;the Atauria.</p>

<p>Now the Egyptians do not appear to have derived their
signs of the Zodiac from the same source; these had a Babylonian
origin, and the constellation in which the Pleiades
were placed by the latter people was the Bull, by whatever
name he went. The Egyptians, we may make the fair
surmise, adopted from both sources; they took the Pleiades
to indicate the Bull, and they called this animal after the
Atauria. From thence we got the Latin Taurus, and the
German Thier.</p>

<p>It is possible that this somehow got connected with the
letter "tau" in Greek, which seems itself connected with the
sacred scarab&aelig;us or Tau-beetle of Egypt; but the nature of
the connection is by no means obvious. Mr. Haliburton even
suggests that the "tors" and "Arthur's seat," which are
names given to British hill-tops, may be connected with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"high places," of the worship of the Pleiades, but of this we
have no proof.</p>

<p>Among the customs possibly derived from the ancients,
through the Ph&#339;nicians, though now adopted as conveying a
different meaning in a Christian sense, is that of the "hot cross
bun," or "bull cake." It is found on Egyptian monuments,
signifying the four quarters of the year, and sometimes
stamped with the head and horns of the bull. It is found
among ourselves too, essentially connected with the dead, and
something similar to it appears in the "soul cake" connected
originally with All Souls' Day.</p>

<p>Among the Scotch it was traditionally thought that on New
Year's Eve the Candlemas Bull can be seen, rising at twilight
and sailing over the heavens&mdash;a very near approach to a matter-of-fact
statement.</p>

<p>We have seen that among the ancient Indians there was
some notice taken of the Pleiades, and that they in all probability
guided their year by them or by some other stars: it
would therefore behove them to know something of the precession
of the equinoxes. It seems very well proved that their
days of Brahma and other periods were meant to represent
some astronomical cycles, and among these we find one that is
applicable to the above. They said that in every thousand
divine ages, or in every day of Brahma, fourteen Menus are
successively invested with the sovereignty of the earth.
Each Menu transmits his empire to his sons during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
seventy-one divine ages. We may find a meaning for this
by putting it that the equinox goes forward fourteen days
in each thousand years, and each day takes up seventy-one
years.</p>

<p>These may not be the only ones among the various customs,
sayings, and names that are due in one way or other to this
primitive method of arranging the seasons by the positions
of the stars, especially of those most remarkable and conspicuous
ones the Pleiades, but they are those that are best
authenticated. If the connection between the Pleiades and
the festival of the dead, the new year and a deluge, can be
clearly made out; if the tradition of the latter be found
as universal as that of the former, and be connected with it
in the Mosaic narrative; if we can trace all these traditions
to the south of the equator, and find numerous further traditions
connected with islands, we may find some reason for
believing in their theory who suggest that the early progenitors
of the human race (? all of them) were inhabitants of
some fortunate islands of even temperature in the southern
hemisphere, where they made some progress in civilisation,
but that their island was swallowed up by the sea, and that
they only escaped by making huge vessels, and, being carried
by the waves, they landed on continental shores, where they
commemorated yearly the great catastrophe that had happened
to them, notifying its time by the position of the
Pleiades, making it a feast of the dead whom they had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
behind, and opening the year with the day, whether it were
spring or not, and handing down to their descendants and to
those among whom they came, the traditions and customs
which such events had impressed upon them.</p>

<p>Whether such an account be probable, mythical, or unnatural,
there are certainly some strange things to account for
in connection with the Pleiades.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE HEAVENS ACCORDING
TO THE ANCIENTS.</h3>


<p>Many and various have been the ideas entertained by
reflecting men in former times on the nature and construction
of the heavenly vault, wherein appeared those stars and
constellations whose history we have already traced. Is it
solid? or liquid? or gaseous? Each of these and many
other suppositions have been duly formulated by the ancient
philosophers and sages, although, as we are told by modern
astronomy, it does not exist at all.</p>

<p>In our study of the ancient ideas about the structure of
the universe, we will commence with that early and curious
system which considered the heavenly vault to be material
and solid.</p>

<p>The theory of a solid sky received the assent of all the
most ancient philosophers. In his commentary on Aristotle's
work on the heavens, Simplicius reveals the repugnance
the ancient philosophers felt in admitting that a star could
stand alone in space, or have a free motion of its own. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
must have a support, and they therefore conceived that the
sky must be solid. However strange this idea may now
appear, it formed for many centuries the basis of all astronomical
theories. Thus Anaximenas (in the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>)
is related by Plutarch to have said that "the outer sky is
solid and crystalline," and that the stars are "fixed to its
surface like studs," but he does not say on what this opinion
was founded, though it is probable that, like his master
Anaximander, he could not understand how the stars could
move without being supported.</p>

<p>Pythagoras, who lived about the same epoch, is also supposed
by some to have held the same views, and it is possible
that they all borrowed these ideas from the Persians, whose
earliest astronomers are said in the <i>Zend avesta</i> to have
believed in concentric solid skies.</p>

<p>Eudoxus of Cnidus, in the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, is said by his
commentator Aratus to have also believed in the solidity of
the heavens, but his reasons are not assigned.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these previously expressed opinions,
Aristotle (fourth century, <small>B.C.</small>) has for a long time been
generally supposed to be the inventor of solid skies, but in
fact he only gave the idea his valuable and entire support.
The sphere of the stars was his eighth heaven. The less
elevated heavens, in which he also believed, were invented to
explain as well as they might, the proper motions of the sun,
moon, and planets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The philosopher of Stagira said that the motion of his
eighth or outermost solid sky was uniform, nor ever troubled
by any perturbation. "Within the universe there is," he
says, "a fixed and immovable centre, the earth; and without
there is a bounding surface enclosing it on all sides. The
outermost part of the universe is the sky. It is filled with
heavenly bodies which we know as stars, and it has a perpetual
motion, carrying round with it these immortal bodies
in its unaltering and unending revolution."</p>

<p>Euclid, to whom we may assign a date of about 275
before our present era, also considered the stars to be set in a
solid sphere, having the eye of the observer as centre; though
for him this conception was simply a deduction from exact
and fundamental observations, namely, that their revolution
took place as a whole, the shape and size of the constellation
being never altered.</p>

<p>Cicero, in the last century before Christ, declared himself a
believer in the solidity of the sky. According to him the ether
was too rarefied to enable it to move the stars, which must
therefore require to be fixed to a sphere of their own,
independent of the ether.</p>

<p>In the time of Seneca there seem to have been difficulties
already raised about the solidity of the heavens, for
he only mentions it in the form of a question&mdash;"Is the sky
solid and of a firm and compact substance?" (<i>Questions</i>,
Book ii.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fifth century the idea of the star sphere still lingered,
and in the eyes of Simplicius, the commentator of Aristotle,
it was not merely an artifice suitable for the representation
of the apparent motions, but a firm and solid reality; while
Mahomet and most of the Fathers of the Christian Church
had the same conception of these concentric spheres.</p>

<p>It appears then from this review that the phrases "starry
vault," and especially "fixed stars," have been used in two
very distinct senses. When we meet with them in Aristotle or
Ptolemy, it is obvious that they have reference to the crystal
sphere of Anaximenas, to which they were supposed to be
affixed, and to move with it; but that later the word
"fixed" carried with it the sense of immovable, and the
stars were conceived as fixed in this sense, independently
of the sphere to which they were originally thought to be
attached. Thus Seneca speaks of them as the <i>fixum et
immobilem populum</i>.</p>

<p>If we would inquire a little further into the supposed
nature of this solid sphere, we find that Empedocles considered
it to be a solid mass, formed of a portion of the ether
which the elementary fire has converted into crystal, and his
ideas of the connection between cold and solidification being
not very precise, he described it by names that give the best
idea of transparence, and, like Lactantius, called it <i>vitreum
c&aelig;lum</i>, or said <i>c&aelig;lum &aelig;rem glaciatum esse</i>, though we cannot
suppose that he made any allusion to what we now call glass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
but simply meant some body eminently transparent into
which the fire had transformed the air; while so far from
having any idea of cold, as we might imagine possible from
observations of the snowy tops of mountains, they actually
believed in a warm region above the lower atmosphere. Thus
Aristotle considers that the spheres heat by their motion the
air below them, without being heated themselves, and that
there is thus a production of heat. "The motion of the
sphere of fixed stars," he says, "is the most rapid, as it
moves in a circle with all the bodies attached to it, and the
spaces immediately below are strongly heated by the motion,
and the heat, thus engendered, is propagated downwards to the
earth." This however, strangely enough, does not appear to
have prevented their supposing an eternal cold to reign in
the regions next below, for Macrobius, in his commentary on
Cicero, speaks of the decrease of temperature with the height,
and concludes that the extreme zones of the heavens where
Saturn moves must be eternally cold; but this they reckoned
as part of the atmosphere, beyond whose limits alone was to
be found the fiery ether.</p>

<p>It is to the Fathers of the Church that we owe the transmission
during the middle ages of the idea of a crystal vault.
They conceived a heaven of glass composed of eight or ten
superposed layers, something like so many skins in an onion.
This idea seems to have lingered on in certain cloisters
of southern Europe even into the nineteenth century, for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
venerable Prince of the Church told Humboldt in 1815, that
a large a&euml;rolite lately fallen, which was covered with a
vitrified crust, must be a fragment of the crystalline sky. On
these various spheres, one enveloping without touching
another, they supposed the several planets to be fixed, as we
shall see in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Whether the greater minds of antiquity, such as Plato,
Plutarch, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Apollonius, believed in the
reality of these concentric spheres to carry the planets, or
whether this conception was not rather with them an
imaginary one, serving only to simplify calculation and
assist the mind in the solution of the difficult problem of
their motion, is a point on which even Humboldt cannot
decide. It is certain, however, that in the middle of the
sixteenth century, when the theory involved no less than
seventy-seven concentric spheres, and later, when the adversaries
of Copernicus brought them all into prominence to
defend the system of Ptolemy, the belief in the existence
of these solid spheres, circles and epicycles, which was
under the especial patronage of the Church, was very
widespread.</p>

<p>Tycho Brahe expressly boasts of having been the first, by
considerations concerning the orbits of the comets, to have
demonstrated the impossibility of solid spheres, and to have
upset this ingenious scaffolding. He supposed the spaces
of our system to be filled with air, and that this medium,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
disturbed by the motion of the heavenly bodies, opposed a
resistance which gave rise to the harmonic sounds.</p>

<p>It should be added also that the Grecian philosophers,
though little fond of observation, but rejoicing rather in
framing systems for the explanation of phenomena of which
they possessed but the faintest glimpse, have left us some
ideas about the nature of shooting stars and a&euml;rolites that
come very close to those that are now accepted. "Some
philosophers think," says Plutarch in his life of Lysander,
"that shooting stars are not detached particles of ether
which are extinguished by the atmosphere soon after being
ignited, nor do they arise from the combustion of the rarefied
air in the upper regions, but that they are rather heavenly
bodies which fall, that is to say, which escaping in some way
from the general force of rotation are precipitated in an
irregular manner, sometimes on inhabited portions of the
earth, but sometimes also in the ocean, where of course they
cannot be found." Diogenes of Apollonius expresses himself
still more clearly: "Amongst the stars that are visible
move others that are invisible, to which in consequence we
are unable to give any name. These latter often fall to the
earth and take fire like that star-stone which fell all on fire near
&AElig;gos Potamos." These ideas were no doubt borrowed from
some more ancient source, as he believed that all the stars
were made of something like pumice-stone. Anaxagoras, in
fact, thought that all the heavenly bodies were fragments of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
rocks which the ether, by the force of its circular motion, had
detached from the earth, set fire to, and turned into stars.
Thus the Ionic school, with Diogenes of Apollonius, placed
the a&euml;rolites and the stars in one class, and assigned to all
of them a terrestrial origin, though in this sense only, that
the earth, being the central body, had furnished the matter
for all those that surround it.</p>

<p>Plutarch speaks thus of this curious combination:&mdash;"Anaxagoras
teaches that the ambient ether is of an igneous
nature, and by the force of its gyratory motion it tears off
blocks of stone, renders them incandescent, and transforms
them into stars." It appears that he explained also by
an analogous effect of the circular motion the descent of the
Nem&aelig;an Lion, which, according to an old tradition, fell out
of the moon upon the Peloponnesus. According to B&#339;ckh,
this ancient myth of the Nem&aelig;an Lion had an astronomical
origin, and was symbolically connected in chronology with
the cycle of intercalation of the lunar year, with the worship
of the moon in Nemaea, and the games by which it was
accompanied.</p>

<p>Anaxagoras explains the apparent motion of the celestial
sphere from east to west by the hypothesis of a general
revolution, the interruption of which, as we have just seen,
caused the fall of meteoric stones. This hypothesis is the
point of departure of the theory of vortices, which more
than two thousand years later, by the labours of Descartes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Huyghens, and Hooke, took so prominent a place among the
theories of the world.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>


<p>It may be worth adding with regard to the famous a&euml;rolite
of &AElig;gos Potamus, alluded to above, that when the heavens
were no longer believed to be solid, the faith in the celestial
origin of this, as of other a&euml;rolites, was for a long time
destroyed. Thus Bailly the astronomer, alluding to it, says,
"if the fact be true, this stone must have been thrown out
by a volcano." Indeed it is only within the last century
that it has been finally accepted for fact that stones do fall
from the sky. Laplace thought it probable that they came
from the moon; but it has now been demonstrated that a&euml;rolites,
meteors, and shooting stars belong all to one class of
heavenly bodies, that they are fragments scattered through
space, and circulate like the planets round the sun. When
the earth in its motion crosses this heavenly host, those
which come near enough to touch its atmosphere leave a
luminous train behind them by their heating by friction
with the air: these are the <i>shooting stars</i>. Sometimes they
come so close as to appear larger than the moon, then they
are <i>meteors;</i> and sometimes too the attraction of the earth
makes them fall to it, and these become <i>a&euml;rolites</i>.</p>

<p>But to return to our ancient astronomers:&mdash;</p>

<p>They believed the heavens to be in motion, not only
because they saw the motion with their eyes, but because
they believed them to be animated, and regarded motion as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the essence of life. They judged of the rapidity of the
stars' motion by a very ingenious means. They perceived
that it was greater than that of a horse, a bird, an arrow,
or even of the voice, and Cleomenas endeavoured to estimate
it in the following way. He remarks that when the king
of Persia made war upon Greece he placed men at certain
intervals, so as to lie in hearing of each other, and thus
passed on the news from Athens to Susa. Now this news
took two days and nights to pass over this distance. The
voice therefore only accomplished a fraction of the distance
that the stars had accomplished twice in the same time.</p>

<p>The heavens, as we have seen, were not supposed to consist
of a single sphere, but of several concentric ones, the
arrangement and names of which we must now inquire into.</p>

<p>The early Chaldeans established three. The first was the
empyreal heaven, which was the most remote. This, which
they called also the solid firmament, was made of fire, but of
fire of so rare and penetrating a nature, that it easily passed
through the other heavens, and became universally diffused,
and in this way reached the earth. The second was the
ethereal heaven, containing the stars, which were simply
formed of the more compact and denser parts of this
substance; and the third heaven was that of the planets. The
Persians, however, gave a separate heaven to the sun, and
another to the moon.</p>

<p>The system which has enjoyed the longest and most widely-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>spread
reign is that which places above, or rather round, the
solid firmament a heaven of water&mdash;(the nature of which
is not accurately defined), and round this a <i>primum mobile</i>,
prime mover, or originator of all the motions, and round all
this the empyreal heaven, or abode of the blessed. In the most
anciently printed scientific encyclop&aelig;dia known, the <i>Magarita
philosophica</i>, edited in the fifteenth century, that is, two centuries
before the adoption of the true system of the world, we
have the curious figure represented on the next page, in which
we find no less than eleven different heavens. We here see
on the exterior the solid empyreal heaven, which is stated in
the body of the work to be the abode of the blessed and to
be immovable, while the next heaven gives motion to all
within, and is followed by the aqueous heaven, then the crystal
firmament, and lastly by the several heavens of the planets,
sun, and moon. The revolution of these spheres was not
supposed to take place, like the motion of the earth in modern
astronomy, round an imaginary axis, but round one which had
a material existence, which was provided with pivots moving
in fixed sockets. Thus Vitruvius, architect to Augustus,
teaches it expressly in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The heaven turns continually round the earth and sea
upon an axis, where two extremities are like two pivots that
sustain it: for there are two places in which the Governor of
Nature has fashioned and set these pivots as two centres; one
is above the earth among the northern stars; the other is at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the opposite end beneath the earth to the south; and around
these pivots, as round two centres, he has placed little naves,
like those of a wheel upon which the heaven turns continually."</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 13.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly curious ideas we shall find to have prevailed
with respect to the meaning of everything that they observed
in the heavens: thus what a number of opinions have been
hazarded on the nature of the "Milky Way" alone! some of
which we may learn from Plutarch. The Milky Way, he says,
is a nebulous circle, which constantly appears in the sky, and
which owes its name to its white appearance. Certain
Pythagoreans assert that when Phaeton lit up the universe,
one star, which escaped from its proper place, set light to the
whole space it passed over in its circular course, and so formed
the Milky Way. Others thought that this circle was where
the sun had been moving at the beginning of the world.
According to others it is but an optical phenomenon produced
by the reflection of the sun's rays from the vault of the sky
as from a mirror, and comparable with the effects seen in the
rainbow and illuminated clouds. Metrodorus says it is the
mark of the sun's passage which moves along this circle.
Parmenidas pretends that the milky colour arises from a
mixture of dense and rare air. Anaxagoras thinks it an
effect of the earth's shadow projected on this part of the
heavens, when the sun is below. Democritus says that it is
the lustre of several little stars which are very near together,
and which reciprocally illuminate each other. Aristotle
believes it to be a vast mass of arid vapours, which takes
fire from a glowing tress, above the region of the ether, and
far below that of the planets. Posidonius says that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
circle is a compound of fire less dense than that of the stars,
but more luminous. All such opinions, except that of
Democritus, are of little value, because founded on nothing;
perhaps the worst is that of Theophrastus, who said it was
the junction between the two hemispheres, which together
formed the vault of heaven: and that it was so badly made
that it let through some of the light that he supposed to
exist everywhere behind the solid sky.</p>

<p>We now know that the Milky Way, like many of the
nebul&aelig;, is an immense agglomeration of suns. The Milky
Way is itself a nebula, a mass of sidereal systems, with our
own among them, since our sun is a single star in this vast
archipelago of eighteen million orbs. The Greeks called it
the Galaxy. The Chinese and Arabians call it the River of
Heaven. It is the Path of Souls among the North American
Indians, and the Road of S. Jacques de Compostelle among
French peasants.</p>

<p>In tracing the history of ideas concerning the structure
of the heavens among the Greek philosophers, we meet with
other modifications which it will be interesting to recount.
Thus Eudoxus, who paid greater attention than others to
the variations of the motions of the planets, gave more than
one sphere to each of them to represent these observed
changes. Each planet, according to him, has a separate part
of the heaven to itself, which is composed of several
concentric spheres, whose movements, modifying each other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
produce that of the planet. He gave three spheres to the
sun: one which turned from east to west in twenty-four
hours, to represent the diurnal rotation; a second, which
turned about the pole of the ecliptic in 365&frac14; days, and
produced its annual movement; and a third was added to
account for a certain supposed motion, by which the sun
was drawn out of the ecliptic, and turned about an axis,
making such an angle with that of the ecliptic, as
represented the supposed aberration. The moon also had
three spheres to produce its motions in longitude and latitude,
and its diurnal motion. Each of the other planets had four,
the extra one being added to account for their stations and
retrogressions. It should be added that these concentric
spheres were supposed to fit each other, so that the different
planets were only separated by the thicknesses of these
crystal zones.</p>

<p>Polemarch, the disciple of Eudoxus, who went to Athens
with his pupil Calippus for the express purpose of consulting
Aristotle on these subjects, was not satisfied with the exactness
with which these spheres represented the planetary
motions, and made changes in the direction of still greater
complication. Instead of the twenty-six spheres which
represented Eudoxus' system, Calippus established thirty-three,
and by adding also intermediary spheres to prevent
the motion of one planet interfering with that of the adjacent
ones, the number was increased to fifty-six.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>There is extant a small work, ascribed to Aristotle, entitled
"Letter of Aristotle to Alexander on the system of the
world," which gives so clear an account of the ideas entertained
in his epoch that we shall venture to give a somewhat
long extract from it. The work, it should be said, is not by
all considered genuine, but is ascribed by some to Nicolas
of Damas, by others to Anaximenas of Lampsacus, a
contemporary of Alexander's, and by others to the Stoic
Posidonius. It is certain, however, that Aristotle paid some
attention to astronomy, for he records the rare phenomena
of an eclipse of Mars by the moon, and the occultation of
one of the Gemini by the planet Jupiter, and the work may
well be genuine. It contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a fixed and immovable centre to the universe.
This is occupied by the earth, the fruitful mother, the
common focus of every kind of living thing. Immediately
surrounding it on all sides is the air. Above this in the
highest region is the dwelling-place of the gods, which
is called the heavens. The heavens and the universe being
spherical and in continual motion, there must be two points
on opposite sides, as in a globe which turns about an axis,
and these points must be immovable, and have the sphere
between them, since the universe turns about them. They
are called the poles. If a line be drawn from one of these
points to the other it will be the diameter of the universe,
having the earth in the centre and the two poles at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
extremities; of these two poles the northern one is always
visible above our horizon, and is called the Arctic pole;
the other, to the south, is always invisible to us&mdash;it is called
the Antarctic pole.</p>

<p>"The substance of the heavens and of the stars is called
ether; not that it is composed of flame, as pretended by
some who have not considered its nature, which is very
different from that of fire, but it is so called because it
has an eternal circular motion, being a divine and incorruptible
element, altogether different from the other four.</p>

<p>"Of the stars contained in the heavens some are fixed, and
turn with the heavens, constantly maintaining their relative
positions. In their middle portion is the circle called the
<i>zoophore</i>, which stretches obliquely from one tropic to the
other, and is divided into twelve parts, which are the twelve
signs (of the zodiac). The others are wandering stars, and
move neither with the same velocity as the fixed stars,
nor with a uniform velocity among themselves, but all
in different circles, and with velocities depending on the
distances of these circles from the earth.</p>

<p>"Although all the fixed stars move on the same surface
of the heavens, their number cannot be determined. Of
the movable stars there are seven, which circulate in as
many concentric circles, so arranged that the lower circle is
smaller than the higher, and that the seven so placed one
within the other are all within the spheres of the fixed stars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the nearer, that is inner, side of this ethereal, immovable,
unalterable, impassible nature is placed our movable,
corruptible, and mortal nature. Of this there are several
kinds, the first of which is fire, a subtle inflammable essence,
which is kindled by the great pressure and rapid motion of
the ether. It is in this region of air, when any disturbance
takes place in it, that we see kindled shooting-stars, streaks
of light, and shining motes, and it is there that comets
are lighted and extinguished.</p>

<p>"Below the fire comes the air, by nature cold and dark, but
which is warmed and enflamed, and becomes luminous by its
motion. It is in the region of the air, which is passive and
changeable in any manner, that the clouds condense, and
rain, snow, frost, and hail are formed and fall to the earth.
It is the abode of stormy winds, of whirlwinds, thunder,
lightning, and many other phenomena.</p>

<p>"The cause of the heaven's motion is God. He is not in
the centre, where the earth is a region of agitation and
trouble, but he is above the outermost circumference, which is
the purest of all regions, a place which we call rightly <i>ouranos</i>,
because it is the highest part of the universe, and <i>olympos</i>,
that is, perfectly bright, because it is altogether separated
from everything like the shadow and disordered movements
which occur in the lower regions."</p>

<p>We notice in this extract a curious etymology of the word
ether, namely, as signifying perpetual motion (&#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#964;&#949;&#949;&#8150;&#957;),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
though it is more probable that its true, as its more generally
accepted derivation is from &#945;&#7988;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#957;, to burn or shine, a meaning
doubtless alluded to in a remarkable passage of Hippocrates,
&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#931;&#940;&#961;&#954;&#969;&#957;. "It appears to me," he says, "that what we
call the principle of heat is immortal, that it knows all, sees
all, hears all, perceives all, both in the past and in the future.
At the time when all was in confusion, the greater part of
this principle rose to the circumference of the universe; it is
this that the ancients have called <i>ether</i>."</p>

<p>The first Greek that can be called an astronomer was
Thales, born at Miletus 641 <small>B.C.</small>, who introduced into Greece
the elements of astronomy. His opinions were these: that
the stars were of the same substance as the earth, but that
they were on fire; that the moon borrowed its light from the
sun, and caused the eclipses of the latter, while it was itself
eclipsed when it entered the earth's shadow; that the earth
was round, and divisible into five zones, by means of five
circles, <i>i.e.</i> the Arctic and Antarctic, the two tropics, and the
equator; that the latter circle is cut obliquely by the ecliptic,
and perpendicularly by the meridian. Up to his time no
division of the sphere had been made beyond the description
of the constellations. These opinions do not appear to have
been rapidly spread, since Herodotus, one of the finest
intellects of Greece, who lived two centuries later, was still
so ill-instructed as to say, in speaking of an eclipse, "The sun
abandoned its place, and night took the place of day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Anaxagoras, of whom we have spoken before, asserted that
the sun was a mass of fire larger than the Peloponnesus.
Plutarch says he regarded it as a burning stone, and Diogenes
Laertius looked upon it as hot iron. For this bold idea he
was persecuted. They considered it a crime that he taught
the causes of the eclipses of the moon, and pretended that
the sun is larger than it looks. He first taught the existence
of one God, and he was taxed with impiety and treason
against his country. When he was condemned to death,
"Nature," he said, "has long ago condemned me to the
same; and as to my children, when I gave them birth I
had no doubt but they would have to die some day." His
disciple Pericles, however, defended him so eloquently that
his life was spared, and he was sent into exile.</p>

<p>Pythagoras, who belonged to the school of Thales, and
who travelled in Ph&#339;nicia, Chaldea, Jud&aelig;a, and Egypt, to
learn their ideas, ventured, in spite of the warnings of the
priests, to submit to the rites of initiation at Heliopolis, and
thence returned to Samos, but meeting with poor reception
there, he went to Italy to teach. From him arose the <i>Italian
School</i>, and his disciples took the name of philosophers (lovers
of wisdom) instead of that of sages. We shall learn more
about him in the chapter on the Harmony of the Spheres.</p>

<p>His first disciple, Empedocles, famous for the curiosity
which led him to his death in the crater of &AElig;tna, as the
story goes, thought that the true sun, the fire that is in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
centre of the universe, illuminated the other hemisphere, and
that what we see is only the reflected image of that, which
is invisible to us, and all of whose movements it follows.</p>

<p>His disciple, Philolaus, also taught that the sun was a mass
of glass, which sent us by reflection all the light that it
scattered through the universe. We must not, however, forget
that these opinions are recorded by historians who probably
did not understand them, and who took in the letter what
was only intended for a comparison or figure.</p>

<p>If we are to believe Plutarch, Xenophanes, who flourished
about 360 <small>B.C.</small>, was very wild in his opinions. He thought
the stars were lighted every night and extinguished every
morning; that the sun is a fiery cloud; that eclipses take
place by the sun being extinguished and afterwards rekindled;
that the moon is inhabited, but is eighteen times
larger than the earth; that there are several suns and several
moons for giving light to different countries. This can only
be matched by those who said the sun went every night
through a hole in the earth round again to the east; or that
it went above ground, and if we did not see it going back it
was because it accomplished the journey in the night.</p>

<p>Parmenidas was the disciple of Xenophanes. He divided
the earth, like Thales, into zones; and he added that it was
suspended in the centre of the universe, and that it did not
fall because there was no reason why it should move in one
direction rather than another. This argument is perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
philosophical, and illustrates a principle employed since the
time of Archimedes, and of which Leibnitz made so much
use.</p>

<p>Such are some of the general ideas which were held by
the Greeks and others on the nature of the heavens, omitting
that of Ptolemy, of which we shall give a fuller account
hereafter. We see that they were all affected by the dominant
idea of the superiority of the earth over the rest of the
universe, and were spoiled for want of the grand conception
of the immensity of space. The universe was for them a
closed space, outside of which there was <i>nothing</i>; and they
busied themselves with metaphysical questions as to the
possibility of space being infinite. In the meantime their
conceptions of the distances separating us from other visible
parts of the universe were excessively cramped. Hesiod, for
instance, thinks to give a grand idea of the size of the
universe by saying that Vulcan's anvil took seven days to
fall from heaven to earth, when in reality, as now calculated,
it would take no less than seventy-two years for the light,
even travelling at a far greater rate, to reach us from one
of the nearest of the fixed stars.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE CELESTIAL HARMONY.</h3>


<p>Nature presents herself to us under various aspects. At
times, it may be, she presents to us the appearance of discord,
and we fail to perceive the unity that pervades the whole of
her actions. At others, however, and most often to an instructed
mind, there is a concord between her various powers,
a harmony even in her sounds, that will not escape us.
Even the wild notes of the tempest and the bass roll of the
thunder form themselves into part of the grand chorus which
in the great opera are succeeded by the solos of the evening
breeze, the songs of birds, or the ripple of the waves. These
are ideas that would most naturally present themselves to
contemplative minds, and such must have been the students
of the silent, but to them harmonious and tuneful, star-lit
sky, under the clear atmosphere of Greece. The various
motions they observed became indissolubly connected in
their minds with music, and they did not doubt that the
heavenly spheres made harmony, if imperceptible to human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
ears. But their ideas were more precise than this. They
discovered that harmony depended on number, and they
attempted to prove that whether the music they might make
were audible or not, the celestial spheres had motions which
were connected together in the same way as the numbers
belonging to a harmony. The study of their opinions on this
point reveals some very curious as well as very interesting
ideas. We may commence by referring to an ancient
treatise by Tim&aelig;us of Locris on the soul of the universe.
To him we owe the first serious exposition of the complete
harmonic cosmography of Pythagoras. We must premise
that, according to this school, God employed all existing
matter in the formation of the universe&mdash;so that it comprehends
all things, and all is in it. "It is a unique, perfect,
and spherical production, since the sphere is the most perfect
of figures; animated and endowed with reason, since that
which is animated and endowed with reason is better than
that which is not."</p>

<p>So begins Tim&aelig;us, and then follows, as a quotation from
Plato, a comparison of the earth to what would appear to
us nowadays to be a very singular animal. Not only, says
Plato, is the earth a sphere, but this sphere is perfect, and
its maker took care that its surface should be perfectly
uniform for many reasons. The universe in fact has no need
of eyes, since there is nothing outside of it to see; nor yet
of ears, since there is nothing but what is part of itself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
make a sound; nor of breathing organs, as it is not surrounded
by air: any organ that should serve to take in
nourishment, or to reject the grosser parts, would be
absolutely useless, for there being nothing outside it, it
could not receive or reject anything. For the same reason
it needs no hands with which to defend itself, nor yet of feet
with which to walk. Of the seven kinds of motion, its
author has given it that which is most suitable for its figure
in making it turn about its axis, and since for the execution
of this rotatory motion no arms or legs are wanted, its maker
gave it none.</p>

<p>With regard to the soul of the universe, Plato, according to
Tim&aelig;us, says that God composed it "of a mixture of the divisible
and indivisible essences, so that the two together might be
united into one, uniting two forces, the principles of two kinds
of motion, one that which is <i>always the same</i>, and the other
that which is <i>always changing</i>. The mixture of these two
essences was difficult, and was not accomplished without
considerable skill and pains. The proportions of the
mixture were according to harmonic numbers, so chosen
that it is possible to know of what, and by what rule,
the soul of the universe is compounded."</p>

<p>By harmonic numbers Tim&aelig;us means those that are
proportional to those representing the consonances of the
musical scale. The consonances known to the ancients were
three in number: the diapason, or octave, in the proportion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
2 to 1, the diapent, or fifth, in that of 3 to 2, and the diatessaron,
or fourth, in that of 4 to 3; when to these are joined the
tones which fill the intervals of the consonances, and are in
the proportion of 9 to 8, and the semitones in that of 256
to 243, all the degrees of the musical scale is complete.</p>

<p>The discovery of these harmonic numbers is due to
Pythagoras. It is stated that when passing one day near a forge,
he noticed that the hammers gave out very accurate musical
concords. He had them weighed, and found that of those
which sounded the octave, one weighed twice as much as the
other; that of those which made a perfect fifth, one weighed
one third more than the other, and in the case of a fourth,
one quarter more. After having tried the hammers, he took
a musical string stretched with weights, and found that when
he had applied a given weight in the first instance to make
any particular note, he had to double the weight to obtain
the octave, to add one third extra only to obtain a fifth, a
quarter for the fourth, and eight for one tone, and about an
eighteenth for a half-tone; or more simply still, he stretched
a cord once for all, and then when the whole length sounded
any note, when stopped in the middle it gave the octave, at
the third it gave the fifth, at the quarter the fourth, at the
eighth the tone, and at the eighteenth the semi-tone.</p>

<p>Since the ancients conceived of the soul by means of
motion, the quantity of motion developed in anything was
their measure of the quantity of its soul. Now the motion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the heavenly bodies seemed to them to depend on their
distance from the centre of the universe, the fastest being
those at the circumference of the whole. To determine the
relative degrees of velocity, they imagined a straight line
drawn outwards from the centre of the earth, as far as the
empyreal heaven, and divided it according to the proportions
of the musical scale, and these divisions they called the
harmonic degrees of the soul of the universe. Taking the
earth's radius for the first number, and calling it unity, or, in
order to avoid fractions, denoting it by 384, the second
degree, which is at the distance of an harmonic third, will be
represented by 384 plus its eighth part, or 432. The third
degree will be 432, plus its eighth part, or 486. The fourth,
being a semitone, will be as 243 to 256, which will give 512;
and so on. The eighth degree will in this way be the double
of 384 or 768, and represents the first octave.</p>

<p>They continued this series to 36 degrees, as in the following
table:&mdash;</p>

Sum of all the terms, 114,695.</small></p>

<p>This series they considered a complete one, because by
taking the terms in their proper intervals, the last becomes
27 times the original number, and in the school of Pythagoras
this 27 had a mystic signification, and was considered as the
perfect number.</p>

<p>The reason for considering 27 a perfect number was curious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
It is the sum of the first linear, square, and cubic numbers
added to unity. First there is 1, which represents the point,
then 2 and 3, the first linear numbers, even and uneven, then
4 and 9, the first square or surface numbers, even and uneven,
and the last 8 and 27, the first solid or cubic numbers, even
and uneven, and 27 is the sum of all the former. Whence,
taking the number 27 as the symbol of the universe, and the
numbers which compose it as the elements, it appeared right
that the soul of the universe should be composed of the
same elements.</p>

<p>On this scale of distances, with corresponding velocities,
they arranged the various planets, and the universe comprehended
all these spheres, from that of the fixed stars (which
was excluded) to the centre of the earth. The sphere of the
fixed stars was the common envelope, or circumference of the
universe, and Saturn, immediately below it, corresponded to the
thirty-sixth tone, and the earth to the first, and the other planets
with the sun and moon at the various harmonic distances.</p>

<p>They reckoned one tone from the earth to the moon, half
a tone from the moon to Mercury, another half-tone to
Venus, one tone and a half from Venus to the sun, one from
the sun to Mars, a semitone from Mars to Jupiter, half a
tone from Jupiter to Saturn, and a tone and a half from
Saturn to the fixed stars; but these distances were not, as
we shall see, universally agreed upon.</p>

<p>According to Tim&aelig;us, the sphere of the fixed stars, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
contains within it no principle of contrariety, being entirely
divine and pure, always moves with an equal motion in the
same direction from east to west. But the stars which are
within it, being animated by the mixed principle, whose
composition has been just explained, and thus containing two
contrary forces, yield on account of one of these forces to the
motion of the sphere of fixed stars from east to west, and by
the other they resist it, and move in a contrary direction, in
proportion to the degree with which they are endowed with
each; that is to say, that the greater the proportion of the material
to the divine force that they possess, the greater is their
motion from west to east, and the sooner they accomplish their
periodic course. Now the amount of this force depends on
the matter they contain. Thus, according to this system, the
planets turn each day by the common motion with all the
heavens about the earth from east to west, but they also
retrograde towards the east, and accomplish their periods
according to their component parts.</p>

<p>The additions which Plato made to this theory have
always been a proverb of obscurity, and none of his commentators
have been able to make anything of them, and
very possibly they were never intended to.</p>

<p>So far the harmony of the heavenly bodies has been
explained with reference to numbers only, and we may add
to this that they reckoned 126,000 stadia, or 14,286 miles, to
represent a tone, which was thus the distance of the earth to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the moon, and the same measurement made it 500,000 from
the earth to the sun, and the same distance from the sun
to the fixed stars.</p>

<p>But Plato teaches in his <i>Republic</i> that there is actual
musical, harmony between the planets. Each of the spheres,
he said, carried with it a Siren, and each of these sounding a
different note, they formed by their union a perfect concert,
and being themselves delighted with their own harmony,
they sang divine songs, and accompanied them by a sacred
dance. The ancients said there were nine Muses, eight
of whom, according to Plato, presided over celestial, and
the ninth over terrestrial things, to protect them from disorder
and irregularity.</p>

<p>Cicero and Macrobius also express opinions on this
harmonious concert. Such great motions, says Cicero,
cannot take place in silence, and it is natural that the
two extremes should have related sounds as in the octave.
The fixed stars must execute the upper note, and the moon
the base. Kepler has improved on this, and says Jupiter
and Saturn sing bass, Mars takes the tenor, the earth and
Venus are contralto, and Mercury is soprano! True, no one
has ever heard these sounds, but Pythagoras himself may
answer this objection. We are always surrounded, he says,
by this melody, and our ears are accustomed to it from our
birth, so that, having nothing different to compare it with, we
cannot perceive it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>We may here recall the further development of the idea
of the soul of the universe, which was the source of this
harmony, and endeavour to find a rational interpretation of
their meaning. They said that nature had made the animals
mortal and ephemeral, and had infused their souls into them,
as they had been extracts from the sun or moon, or even from
one of the planets. A portion of the unchangeable essence
was added to the reasoning part of man, to form a germ of
wisdom in privileged individuals. For the human soul there
is one part which possesses intelligence and reason, and
another part which has neither the one nor the other.</p>

<p>The various portions of the general soul of the universe
resided, according to Tim&aelig;us, in the different planets, and
depended on their various characters. Some portions were
in the moon, others in Mercury, Venus, or Mars, and so on,
and thus they give rise to the various characters and
dispositions that are seen among men. But to these parts
of the human soul that are taken from the planets is joined
a spark of the supreme Divinity, which is above them all,
and this makes man a more holy animal than all the rest,
and enables him to have immediate converse with the
Deity himself. All the different substances in nature were
supposed to be endowed with more or less of this soul, according
to their material nature or subtilty, and were placed in
the same order along the line, from the centre to the circumference,
on which the planets were situated, as we have seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
above. In the centre was the earth, the heaviest and
grossest of all, which had but little if any soul at all.
Between the earth and the moon, Tim&aelig;us placed first water,
then the air, and lastly elementary fire, which he considered
to be principles, which were less material in proportion
as they were more remote and partook of a larger quantity
of the soul of the universe. Beyond the moon came all the
planets, and thus were filled up the greater number of the
harmonic degrees, the motions of the various bodies being
guided by the principle enunciated above.</p>

<p>When we carefully consider this theory we find that by a
slight change of name we may bring it more into harmony
with modern ideas. It would appear indeed that the
ancients called that "soul" which we now call "force," and
while we say that this force of attraction is in proportion to
the masses and the inverse square of the distance, they
put it that it was proportional to the matter, and to the
divine substance on which the distance depended. So that
we may interpret Tim&aelig;us as stating this proposition: <i>The
distances of the stars and their forces are proportional among
themselves to their periodic times.</i> "Some people," says
Plutarch, "seek the proportions of the soul of the universe
in the velocities (or periodic times), others in the distances
from the centre; some in the masses of the heavenly bodies,
and others more acute in the ratios of the diameters of their
orbits.  It is probable that the mass of each planet, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
intervals between the spheres and the velocities of their
motions, are like well-tuned musical instruments, all proportional
harmonically with each other and with all other parts
of the universe, and by necessary consequence that there are
the same relative proportions in the soul of the universe by
which they were formed by the Deity."</p>

<p>It is marvellous how deeply occupied were all the best
minds in Greece and Italy on this subject, both poets and
philosophers; Ocellus, Democritus, Tim&aelig;us, Aristotle, and
Lucretius have all left treatises on the same subject, and
almost with the same title, "The Nature of the Universe."</p>

<p>Though somewhat similar to that of Tim&aelig;us, it will be
interesting to give an account of the ideas of one of these,
Ocellus of Lucania.</p>

<p>Ocellus represents the universe as having a spherical form.
This sphere is divided into concentric layers; above that of
the moon they were called celestial spheres, while below it and
inwards as far as the centre of the earth they were called the
elementary spheres, and the earth was the centre of them all.</p>

<p>In the celestial spheres all the stars were situated, which
were so many gods, and among them the sun, the largest
and most powerful of all. In these spheres is never any
disturbance, storm, or destruction, and consequently no reparation,
no reproduction, no action of any kind was required
on the part of the gods. Below the moon all is at war, all
is destroyed and reconstructed, and here therefore it is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
generations are possible. But these take place under the
influence of the stars, and particularly that of the sun, which
in its course acts in different ways on the elementary spheres,
and produces continual variations in them, from whence
arises the replenishing and diversifying of nature. It is the
sun that lights up the region of fire, that dilates the air,
melts the water, and renders fertile the earth, in its daily
course from east to west, as well as in this annual journey
into the two tropics. But to what does the earth owe its
germs and its species? According to some philosophers
these germs were celestial ideas which both gods and
demons scattered from above over every part of nature, but
according to Ocellus they arise continually under the
influence of the heavenly bodies. The divisions of the
heavens were supposed to separate the portion that is unalterable
from that which is in ceaseless change. The line
dividing the mortal from the immortal is that described by
the moon: all that lies above that, inclusive, is the habitation
of the gods; all that lies below is the abode of nature and
discord; the latter tending constantly to destruction, the
former to the reconstruction of all created things.</p>

<p>Ideas such as these, of which we could give other examples
more remotely connected with harmony, whatever amount
of truth we may discover in them, prove themselves to have
been made before the sciences of observation had enabled
men to make anything better than empty theories, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
support them with false logic. No better example of the
latter can perhaps be mentioned here than the way in which
Ocellus pretends to prove that the world is eternal. "The
universe," he says, "<i>having</i> always existed, it follows that
everything in it and every arrangement of it must always
have been as it is now. The several parts of the universe
<i>having</i> always existed with it, we may say the same of the
parts of these parts; thus the sun, the moon, the fixed
stars, and the planets have always existed with the heavens;
animals, vegetables, gold, and silver with the earth; the
currents of air, winds, and changes from hot to cold, from
cold to hot, with the air. <i>Therefore</i> the heaven, with all
that it now contains; the earth, with all that it produces
and supports; and lastly, the whole a&euml;rial region, with all its
phenomena, have always existed." When this system of argument
passed away, and exact observation took its place, it was
soon found that so far from what the ancients had argued
<i>must be</i> really being the case, no such relation as they indicated
between the distances or velocities of the planets could
be traced, and therefore no harmony in the heavens in this
sense. It is not indeed that we can say no sounds exist
because we hear none; but considering harmony really to
consist of the relations of numbers, no such relations exist
between the planets' distances, as measured now of course
from the sun, instead of being, as then, imagined from
the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The gamut is nothing else than the series of numbers:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" width="80%">
<tr><td align='center'>do</td><td align='center'>re</td><td align='center'>mi</td><td align='center'>fa</td><td align='center'>sol</td><td align='center'>la</td><td align='center'>si</td><td align='center'>do</td></tr>

<p class="noin">and is independent of our perception of the corresponding notes.
A concert played before a deaf assembly would be a concert
still. If one note is made by 10,000 vibrations per second,
and another by 20,000, we should hear them as an octave,
but if one had only 10 and the other 20, they would still be
an octave, though inaudible as notes to us; so too we may
speak even of the harmony of luminous vibrations of ether,
though they do not affect our ears.</p>

<p>The velocities of the planets do not coincide with the terms
of this series. The nearer they are to the sun the faster is
their motion, Mercury travelling at the mean rate of 55,000
metres a second, Venus, 36,800, the earth 30,550, Mars
24,448, Jupiter 13,000, Saturn 9,840, Uranus 6,800, and
Neptune 5,500, numbers which are in the proportion roundly
of 100, 67, 55, 44, 24, 16, 12, 10, which have no sufficient
relation to the terms of an harmonic series, to make any
harmony obvious.</p>

<p>Returning, however, to the ancient philosophers, we are
led by their ideas about the soul of the universe to discover
the origin of their gods and natural religion. They were
persuaded that only living things could move, and consequently
that the moving stars must be endowed with superior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
intelligence. It may very well be that from the number
seven of the planets, including the sun and moon, which
were their earliest gods, arose the respect and superstition
with which all nations, and especially the Orientals, regarded
that number. From these arose the seven superior angels
that are found in the theologies of the Chaldeans, Persians,
and Arabians; the seven gates of Mithra, through which all
souls must pass to reach the abode of bliss; the seven worlds
of purification of the Indians, and all the other applications
of the number seven which so largely figure in Judaism,
and have descended from it to our own time. On the other
hand, as we have seen, this number seven may have been
derived from the number of the stars in the Pleiades.</p>

<p>We have noticed in our chapter on the History of the
Zodiac how the various signs as they came round and were
thought to influence the weather and other natural phenomena,
came at last to be worshipped. Not less, of course,
were the sun and moon deified, and that by nations who
had no zodiac. Among the Egyptians the sun was painted
in different forms according to the time of year, very much
as he is represented in our own days in pictures of the
old and new years. At the winter solstice with them he
was an infant, at the spring equinox he was a young man,
in summer a man in full age with flowing beard, and
in the autumn an old man. Their fable of Osiris was
founded on the same idea. They represented the sun by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hawk, and the moon by the Ibis, and to these two,
worshipped under the names of Osiris and Isis they
attributed the government of the world, and built a city,
Heliopolis, to the former, in the temple of which they
placed his statue.</p>

<p>The Phenicians in the same way, who were much influenced
by ideas of religion, attributed divinity to the
sun, moon, and stars, and regarded them as the sole causes
of the production and destruction of all things. The sun,
under the name of Hercules, was their great divinity.</p>

<p>The Ethiopians worshipped the same, and erected the
famous table of the sun. Those who lived above Mero&euml;,
admitted the existence of eternal and incorruptible gods,
among which they included the sun, moon, and the universe.
Like the Incas of Peru, they called themselves the children
of the sun, whom they regarded as their common father.</p>

<p>The moon was the great divinity of the Arabs. The
Saracens called it Cabar, or the great, and its crescent still
adorns the religious monuments of the Turks. Each of
their tribes was under the protection of some particular
star. Sabeism was the principal religion of the east. The
heavens and the stars were its first object.</p>

<p>In reading the sacred books of the ancient Persians
contained in the <i>Zendavesta</i>, we find on every page invocations
addressed to Mithra, to the moon, the stars, the
elements, the mountains, the trees, and every part of nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The ethereal fire circulating through all the universe, and of
which the sun is the principal focus, was represented among
the fire-worshippers by the sacred and perpetual fire of their
priests. Each planet had its own particular temple, where
incense was burnt in its honour. These ancient peoples
embodied in their religious systems the ideas which, as we
have seen, led among the Greeks to the representation of the
harmony of heaven. All the world seemed to them animated
by a principle of life which circulated through all parts,
and which preserved it in an eternal activity. They thought
that the universe lived like man and the other animals, or
rather that these latter only lived because the universe was
essentially alive, and communicated to them for an instant
an infinitely small portion of its own immortality. They
were not wise, it may be, in this, but they appear to have
caught some of the ideas that lie at the basis of religious
thought, and to have traced harmony where we have almost
lost the perception of it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEMS.</h3>


<p>In our former chapters we have gained some idea of the
general structure of the heavens as represented by ancient
philosophers, and we no longer require to know what was
thought in the infancy of astronomy, when any ideas promulgated
were more or less random ones; but in this chapter
we hope to discuss those arrangements of the heavenly bodies
which have been promulgated by men as complete systems,
and were supposed to represent the totality of the facts.</p>

<p>The earliest thoroughly-established system is that of
Ptolemy. It was not indeed invented by him. The main
ideas had been entertained long before his time, but he gave
it consistence and a name.</p>

<p>We obtain an excellent view of the general nature of this
system from Cicero. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The universe is composed of nine circles, or rather of
nine moving globes. The outermost sphere is that of the
heavens which surrounds all the others, and on which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
fixed the stars.  Beneath this revolve seven other globes,
carried round by a motion in a direction contrary to that of
the heavens. On the first circle revolves the star which men
call Saturn; on the second Jupiter shines, that beneficent
and propitious star to human eyes; then follows Mars, ruddy
and awful. Below, and occupying the middle region, revolves
the Sun, the chief, prince, and moderator of the other stars,
the soul of the world, whose immense globe spreads its light
through space. After him come, like two companions, Venus
and Mercury. Lastly, the lowest globe is occupied by the
moon, which borrows its light from the star of day. Below
this last celestial circle, there is nothing but what is mortal
and corruptible, except the souls given by a beneficent
Divinity to the race of men. Above the moon all is eternal.
The earth, situated in the centre of the world, and separated
from heaven on all sides, forms the ninth sphere; it remains
immovable, and all heavy bodies are drawn to it by their
own weight."</p>

<p>The earth, we should add, is surrounded by the sphere of air,
and then by that of fire, and by that of ether and the meteors.</p>

<p>With respect to the motions of these spheres. The first
circle described about the terrestrial system, namely, that of
the moon, was accomplished in 27 days, 7 hours, and 43
minutes. Next to the moon, Mercury in the second, and
Venus in the third, and the sun in the fourth circle, all turned
about the earth in the same time, 365 days, 5 hours, and 49<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
minutes. But these planets, in addition to the general movement,
which carried them in 24 hours round from east to
west and west to east, and the annual revolution, which made
them run through the zodiacal circle, had a third motion by
which they described a circle about each point of their orbit
taken as a centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 680px;">
<img src="images/205.jpg" width="680" height="630" alt="Fig. 14." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Ptolemy&#39;s Astronomical System.</span>
</div>

<p>The fifth sphere, carrying Mars, accomplished its revolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in two years. Jupiter took 11 years, 313 days, and 19 hours
to complete his orbit, and Saturn in the seventh sphere took
29 years and 169 days. Above all the planets came the
sphere of the fixed stars, or Firmament, turning from east to
west in 24 hours with inconceivable rapidity, and endued
also with a proper motion from west to east, which was
measured by Hipparchus, and which we now call the precession
of the equinoxes, and know that it has a period of
25,870 years. Above all these spheres, a <i>primum mobile</i>
gave motion to the whole machine, making it turn from east
to west, but each planet and each fixed star made an effort
against this motion, by means of which each of them accomplished
their revolution about the earth in greater or less
time, according to its distance, or the magnitude of the orbit
it had to accomplish.</p>

<p>One immense difficulty attended this system. The apparent
motions of the planets is not uniform, for sometimes they are
seen to advance from west to east, when their motion is called
<i>direct</i>, sometimes they are seen for several nights in succession
at the same point in the heavens, when they are called
<i>stationary</i>, and sometimes they return from east to west, and
then their motion is called <i>retrograde</i>.</p>

<p>We know now that this apparent variation in the motion
of the planets is simply due to the annual motion of the
earth in its orbit round the sun. For example, Saturn describes
its vast orbit in about thirty years, and the earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
describes in one year a much smaller one inside. Now if
the earth goes faster in the same direction as Saturn, it is
plain that Saturn will be left behind and appear to go backwards,
while if the earth is going in the same direction
the velocity of Saturn will appear to be decreased, but his
direction of motion will appear unaltered.</p>

<p>To explain these variations, however, according to his
system, Ptolemy supposed that the planets did not move
exactly in the circumference of their respective orbits, but
about an <i>ideal centre</i>, which itself moved along this circumference.
Instead therefore of describing a circle, they
described parts of a series of small circles, which would
combine, as is easy to see, into a series of uninterrupted
waves, and these he called <i>Epicycles</i>.</p>

<p>Another objection, which even this arrangement did not
overcome, was the variation of the size of the planets. To
overcome this Hipparchus gave to the sphere of each planet
a considerable thickness, and saw that the planet did not
turn centrally round the earth, but round a centre of motion
placed outside the earth. Its revolution took place in such
a manner, that at one time it reached the inner boundary, at
another time the outer boundary of its spherical heaven.</p>

<p>But this reply was not satisfactory, for the differences in
the apparent sizes proved by the laws of optics such a prodigious
difference between their distances from the earth
at the times of conjunction and opposition, that it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
extremely difficult to imagine spheres thick enough to allow
of it.</p>

<p>It was a gigantic and formidable piece of machinery to
which it was necessary to be continually adding fresh pieces
to make observation accord with theory. In the thirteenth
century, in the times of the King-Astronomer, Alphonso X.
of Castile, there were already seventy-five circles, one within
the other. It is said that one day he exclaimed, in a full
assemblage of bishops, that if the Deity had done him the
honour to ask his advice before creating the world, he could
have told Him how to make it a little better, or at all events
more simply. He meant to express how unworthy this
complication was of the dignity of nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/208.jpg" width="350" height="330" alt="Fig. 15." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 15.&mdash;The Epicycles of Ptolemy.</span>
</div>

<p>Fracastor, in his <i>Homocentrics</i>, says that nothing is more
monstrous or absurd than all the excentrics and epicycles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Ptolemy, and proposes to explain the difference of velocity
in the planets at different parts of their orbits by the medium
offering greater or less resistance, and their alteration in
apparent size by the effect of refraction.</p>

<p>The essential element of this system was that it took
appearances for realities, and was founded on the assumption
that the earth is fixed in the centre of the universe, and of
course therefore neglected all the appearances produced
by its motion, or had to explain them by some peculiarity
in the other planets.</p>

<p>Although it was corrected from time to time to make
it accord better with observation, it was the same essentially
that was taught officially everywhere. It reigned supreme
in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and Arabia, and in the great school
of Alexandria, which consolidated it and enriched it by its
own observations.</p>

<p>But though the same in essence, the details, and especially
the means of overcoming the difficulties raised by increased
observations, have much varied, and it will be interesting
and instructive to record some of the chief of them.</p>

<p>One of the most important influences in modifying the
astronomical systems taught to the world has been that
of the Fathers of the Christian Church. When, after five
centuries of patient toil, of hopes, ambitions, and discussions,
the Christian Church took possession of the thrones and
consciences of men, they founded their physical edifice on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the ancient system, which they adapted to their special
wants. With them Aristotle and Ptolemy reigned supreme.
They decreed that the earth constituted the universe, that
the heavens were made for it, that God, the angels, and the
saints inhabited an eternal abode of joy situated above the
azure sphere of the fixed stars, and they embodied this
gratifying illusion in all their illuminated manuscripts, their
calendars, and their church windows.</p>

<p>The doctors of the Church all acknowledged a plurality
of heavens, but they differed as to the number. St. Hilary
of Poitiers would not fix it, and the same doubt held St.
Basil back; but the rest, for the most part borrowing their
ideas from paganism, said there were six or seven, or up to ten.
They considered these heavens to be so many hemispheres
supported on the earth, and gave to each a different name.
In the system of Bede, which had many adherents, they
were the Air, Ether, Fiery Space, Firmament, Heaven of
the Angels, and Heaven of the Trinity.</p>

<p>The two chief varieties in the systems of the middle ages
may be represented as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those who wished to have everything as complete as
possible combined the system of Ptolemy with that of the
Fathers of the Church, and placed in the centre of the earth
the infernal regions which they surrounded by a circle.
Another circle marked the earth itself, and after that the
surrounding ocean, marked as water, then the circle of air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and lastly that of fire. Enveloping these, and following one
after the other, were the seven circles of the seven planets;
the eighth represented the sphere of the fixed stars on the
firmament, then came the ninth heaven, then a tenth, the
<i>c&#339;lum cristallinum</i>, and lastly an eleventh and outermost,
which was the empyreal heaven, where dwelt the cherubim
and seraphim, and above all the spheres was a throne on
which sat the Father, as Jupiter Olympus.</p>

<p>The others who wished for more simplicity, represented
the earth in the centre of the universe, with a circle to
indicate the ocean, the second sphere was that of the moon;
the third was that of the sun; on the fourth were placed the
four planets, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury; there was a
fifth for the space outside the planets, and the last outside one
was the firmament; altogether seven spheres instead of eleven.
As a specimen of the style of representation of the astronomical
systems of the middle ages, we may take the figure on the
following page:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 670px;">
<img src="images/212.jpg" width="670" height="780" alt="Fig. 16." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Heavens of the Middle Ages.</span>
</div>

<p>Here we see the earth placed immovable in the centre of
the universe, and represented by a disc traversed by the
Mediterranean, and surrounded by the ocean. Round this
are circumscribed the celestial spheres. That of the moon
first, then that of Mercury, in which several constellations,
as the Lyre, Cassiopeia, the Crown, and others, are
roughly indicated, then comes the sphere of Venus with
Sagittarius and the Swan.  After this comes the <i>celestis
paradisus</i>, and the legend that, "the paradise to which Paul
was raised is in this third locality; some of these must reach
to us, since in them repose the souls of the prophets." In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the other circles are yet other constellations: for example
Pegasus, Andromeda, the Dog, Argo, the He-goat, Aquarius,
the Fishes, and Canopus, figured by a star of the first
magnitude. To the north is seen near the constellation of
the Swan a large star with seven rays, meant to represent
the brightest of those which compose the Great Bear. The
stars of Cassiopeia are not only misplaced, but roughly
represented. The Lyre is curiously drawn. The positions
of the constellations just named are all wrong in this figure,
just as we find those of towns in maps of the earth. The
cartographers of the middle ages, with incredible ignorance,
misplaced in general every locality. They did the same for
the constellations in the celestial hemispheres. In the
heaven of Jupiter, and in that of Saturn we read the words&mdash;Seraphim,
Dominationes, Potestates, Archangeli, Virtutes
c&#339;lorum, Principatus, Throni, Cherubim, all derived from
their theology. A veritable muddle! The angels placed
with the heroes of mythology, the immortal virgins with
Venus and Andromeda, and the Saints with the Great Bear,
the Hydra, and the Scorpion!</p>

<p>Another such richly illuminated manuscript in the library
at Ghent, entitled Liber Floridus, contains a drawing similar
to this under the title <i>Astrologia secundum Bedum</i>. Only,
instead of the earth, there is a serpent in the centre with the
name Great Bear, and the twins are represented by a man
and woman, Andromeda in a chasuble, and Venus as a nun!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Several similar ones might be quoted, varying more or less
from this; one, executed in a geographical manuscript of the
fifteenth century, has the tenth sphere, being that of the
fixed stars, then the crystalline heaven, and then the immovable
heaven, "which," it says, "according to sacred and
certain theology, is the dwelling-place of the blessed, where
may we live for ever and ever, Amen;" "this is also called
the empyreal heaven." Near each planet the author marks
the time of its revolution, but not at all correctly.</p>

<p>The constructors of these systems were not in the least
doubt as to their reality, for they actually measured the
distance between one sphere and another, though in every
case their numbers were far from the truth as we now know
it. We may cite as an example an Italian system whose
spheres were as follows:&mdash;Terra, Aqua, Aria, Fuoco, Luna,
Mercurio, Venus, Sol, Marte, Giove, Saturno, Stelle fixe,
Sfera nona, Cielo empyreo. Attached to the design is the
following table of dimensions which we may copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>The author states that he cannot pursue his calculations
further, and condescends to acknowledge that it is very
difficult to know accurately what is the thickness of the
ninth and of the crystalline heavens!</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, these reckonings are better than those
of the Egyptians, who came to the conclusion that Saturn
was only distant 492 miles, the sun only 369, and the
moon 246.</p>

<p>These numerous variations and adaptations of the Ptolemaic
system, prove what a firm hold it had taken, and how
it reigned supreme over all minds. Nor are we merely left
to gather this. They consciously looked to Ptolemy as their
great light, if we may judge from an emblematic drawing
taken from an authoritative astronomical work, the <i>Margarita
Philosophica</i>, which we give on the opposite page.</p>

<p>In all the systems derived from Ptolemy, the order of the
planets remained the same, and Mercury and Venus were
placed nearer to the earth than the sun is. According to
many authors, however, Plato made a variation in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
respect, by putting them outside the sun, on the ground
that they never were seen to pass across its surface. He
had obviously never heard of the "Transit of Venus."
This arrangement was adopted by Theon, in his commentary
on the <i>Almagesta</i> of Ptolemy, and afterwards by Geber,
who alone among the Arabians departed from the strict
Ptolemaic system.</p>

<p>The Egyptians improved upon this idea, and made the first
step towards the true system, by representing these two planets,
Mercury and Venus, as revolving round the sun instead of
the earth. All the rest of their system was the same as that
of Ptolemy, for the sun itself, and the other planets and the
fixed stars all revolved round the earth in the centre. This
system of course accounted accurately for the motions of the
two inferior planets, whose nearness to the sun may have
suggested their connection with it. This system was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
vogue at the same time as Ptolemy's, and numbers Vitruvius
amongst its supporters.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Capella&#39;s System.</span>
</div>

<p>In the fifth century of our era Martian Capella taught a
variation on the Egyptian system, in which he made Mercury
and Venus revolve in the same orbit round the sun. In the
treatise entitled <i>Quod Tellus non sit Centrum Omnibus
Planetis</i>, he explains that when Mercury is on this side
of the orbit it is nearer to us than Venus, and farther off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
from us than that planet when it is on the other side. This
hypothesis was also adopted in the middle ages.</p>

<p>We have here indicated the time of the revolution of
the various planets, and notice that the firmament is
said to move round from west to east in 7,000 years;
the second heaven in 49,000, while the <i>primum mobile</i>
outside moved in the contrary direction in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>These Egyptian systems survived in some places the
true one, as they were thought to overcome the chief
difficulties of the Ptolemaic without interfering with the
stability of the earth, and they were known as the <i>common
system</i>, <i>i.e.</i> containing the elements of both.</p>

<p>Such were the astronomical systems in vogue before the
time of Copernicus&mdash;all of them based upon the principle of
the earth being the immovable centre of the universe. We
must now turn to trace the history of the introduction of
that system which has completely thrown over all these
former ones, and which every one knows now to be the true
one&mdash;the Copernican.</p>

<p>No revolution is accomplished, whether in science or
politics, without having been long in preparation. The
theory of the motion of the earth had been conceived,
discussed, and even taught many ages before the birth of
Copernicus. And the best proof of this is the acknowledgment
of Copernicus himself in his great work <i>De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Revolutionibus Orbium C&aelig;lestium</i>, in which he laid down
the principles of his system. We will quote the passage
in which it is contained.</p>

<p>"I have been at the trouble," he writes, "to read over
all the works of philosophers that I could procure, to see
if I could find in them any different opinion to that which
is now taught in the schools respecting the motions of
the celestial spheres. And I saw first in Cicero that
M&aelig;tas had put forth the opinion that the earth moves.
(M&aelig;tam sensisse terram moveri.) Afterwards I found in
Plutarch that others had entertained the same idea."</p>

<p>Here Copernicus quotes the original as far as it relates
to the system of Philolaus, to the effect "that the earth
turns round the region of fire (ethereal region), and runs
through the zodiac like the sun and the moon." The
principal Pythagoreans, such as Archytas of Tarentum,
Heraclides of Pontium, taught also the same doctrine,
saying that "the earth is not immovable in the centre of the
universe, but revolves in a circle, and is far from occupying
the chief place among the celestial bodies."</p>

<p>Pythagoras learnt this doctrine, it is said, from the
Egyptians, who in their hieroglyphics represented the
symbol of the sun by the stercoral beetle, because this
insect forms a ball with the excrement of the oxen, and
lying down on its back, turns it round and round with
its legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim&aelig;us of Locris was more precise than the other
Pythagoreans in calling "the five planets the organs of
time, on account of their revolutions," adding that we must
conclude that the earth is not immovable in one place,
but that it turns, on the contrary, about itself, and travels
also through space.</p>

<p>Plutarch records that Plato, who had always taught that
the sun turned round the earth, had changed his opinion
towards the end of his life, regretting that he had not
placed the sun in the centre of the universe, which was
the only place, he then thought, that was suitable for
that star.</p>

<p>Three centuries before Jesus Christ, Aristarchus of
Samos is said by Aristotle to have composed a special
work to defend the motion of the earth against the contrary
opinions of philosophers. In this work, which is now lost,
he laid down in the most positive manner that "the sun
remains immovable, and that the Earth moves round it in
a circular curve, of which that star is the centre." It
would be impossible to state this in clearer terms; and
what makes his meaning more clear, if possible, is that he
was persecuted for it, being accused of irreligion and of
troubling the repose of Vesta&mdash;"because," says Plutarch,
"in order to explain the phenomena, he taught that the
heavens were immovable, and that the earth accomplished
a motion of translation in an oblique line, at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
time that it turned round its own axis." This is exactly
the opinion that Copernicus took up, after an interval of
eighteen centuries&mdash;and he too was accused of irreligion.</p>

<p>In passing from the Greeks to the Romans, and from
them to the middle ages, the doctrine of Aristarchus
underwent a curious modification, assimilating it to the
system of Tycho Brahe, which we shall hereafter consider,
rather than to that of Copernicus. This consisted in
making the planets move round the sun, while the sun
itself revolved round the earth, and carried them with
him, and the heavens revolved round all. Vitruvius and
Macrobius both taught this doctrine. Although Cicero and
Seneca, with Aristotle and the Stoics, taught the immobility
of the earth in the centre of the universe, the question
seemed undecided, to Seneca at least, who writes:&mdash;"It
would be well to examine whether it is the universe that
turns about the immovable earth, or the earth that moves,
while the universe remains at rest. Indeed some men have
taught that the earth is carried along, unknown to ourselves,
that it is not the motion of the heavens that produces the
rising and setting of the stars, but that it is we who rise
and set relatively to them. It is a matter worthy of contemplation,
to know in what state we are&mdash;whether we are
assigned an immovable or rapidly-moving home&mdash;whether
God makes all things revolve round us, or we round them."</p>

<p>The double motion of the earth, then, is an idea revived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
from the Grecian philosophers. The theory was known
indeed to Ptolemy, who devotes a whole chapter in his
celebrated <i>Almagesta</i> to combat it. From his point of view
it seemed very absurd, and he did not hesitate to call it so;
and it was in reality only when fresh discoveries had altered
the method of examining the question that the absurdities
disappeared, and were transferred to the other side. Not
until it was discovered that the earth was no larger and no
heavier than the other planets could the idea of its revolution
and translation have appeared anything else than
absurd. We are apt to laugh at the errors of former great
men, while we forget the scantiness of the knowledge they
then possessed. So it will be instructive to draw attention
to Ptolemy's arguments, that we may see where it is that
new knowledge and ideas have led us, as they would doubtless
have led him, had he possessed them, to a different
conclusion.</p>

<p>His argument depends essentially on the observed effects
of weight. "Light bodies," he says, "are carried
towards the circumference, they appear to us to go <i>up</i>;
because we so speak of the space that is over our heads,
as far as the surface which appears to surround us. Heavy
bodies tend, on the contrary, towards the middle, as towards
a centre, and they appear to us to fall <i>down</i>, because we
so speak of whatever is under our feet, in the direction
of the centre of the earth. These bodies are piled up round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the centre by the opposed forces of their impetus and
friction. We can easily see that the whole mass of the
earth, being so large compared with the bodies that fall upon
it, can receive them without their weight or their velocity
communicating to it any perceptible oscillation. Now if
the earth had a motion in common with all the other heavy
bodies, it would not be long, on account of its weight, in
leaving the animals and other bodies behind it, and without
support, and it would soon itself fall out of heaven. Such
would be the consequences of its motion, which are most
ridiculous even to imagine."</p>

<p>Against the idea of the earth's diurnal rotation he
argued as follows:&mdash;"There are some who pretend that
nothing prevents us from supposing that the heaven remains
immovable, and the earth turns round upon its axis from
west to east, accomplishing the rotation each day. It is
true that, as far as the stars are concerned, there is nothing
against our supposing this, if guided only by appearances,
and for greater simplicity; but those who do so forget how
thoroughly ridiculous it is when we consider what happens
near us and in the air. For even if we admit, which is
not the case, that the lighter bodies have no motion, or
only move as bodies of a contrary nature, although we see
that a&euml;rial bodies move with greater velocity than terrestrial&mdash;if
we admit that very dense and heavy bodies have
a rapid and constant motion of their own, whereas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in reality they obey but with difficulty the impulses
communicated to them&mdash;we should then be obliged to
assert that the earth, by its rotation, has a more rapid
motion than any of the bodies that are round it, as it
makes so large a circuit in so short a time. In this case
the bodies which are not supported by it would appear to
have a motion contrary to it, and no cloud or any flying bird
could ever appear to go to the east, since the earth would
always move faster than it in that direction."</p>

<p>The <i>Almagesta</i> was for a long time the gospel of astronomers;
to believe in the motion of the earth was to them
more than an innovation, it was simply folly. Copernicus
himself well expresses the state of opinion in which he found
the question, and the process of his own change, in the
following words:&mdash;"And I too, taking occasion by these
testimonies, commenced to cogitate on the motion of the earth,
and although that opinion appeared absurd, I thought that
as others before me had invented an assemblage of circles
to explain the motion of the stars, I might also try if, by
supposing the earth to move, I could not find a better
account of the motions of the heavenly bodies than that with
which we are at present contented. After long researches,
I am at last convinced that if we assign to the circulation of
the earth the motions of the other planets, calculation and
observation will agree better together. And I have no doubt
that mathematicians will be of my opinion, if they will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
take the trouble to consider carefully and not superficially
the demonstrations I shall give in this work." Although the
opinions of Copernicus had been held before, it is very just
that his should be the name by which they are known; for
during the time that elapsed before he wrote, the adherents
of such views became fewer and fewer, until at last the very
remembrance of them was almost forgotten, and it required
research to know who had held them and taught them. It
took him thirty years' work to establish them on a firm
basis. We shall make no excuse for quoting further from
his book, that we may know exactly the circumstances, as
far as he tells us, of his giving this system to the world.</p>

<p>"I hesitated for a long time whether I should publish my
commentaries on the motions of the heavenly bodies, or
whether it would not be better to follow the example of
certain Pythagoreans, who left no writings, but communicated
the mysteries of their philosophy orally from man to man
among their adepts and friends, as is proved by the letter
of Lysidas to Hipparchus. They did not do this, as some
suppose, from a spirit of jealousy, but in order that weighty
questions, studied with great care by illustrious men, might
not be disparaged by the idle, who do not care to undertake
serious study, unless it be lucrative, or by shallow-minded
men, who, though devoting themselves to science, are of so
indolent a spirit that they only intrude among philosophers,
like drones among bees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I hesitated and held back, my friends pressed me
on. The first was Nicolas Schonberg, Cardinal of Capua, a
man of great learning. The other was my best friend,
Tideman Gysius, Bishop of Culm, who was as well versed in
the Holy Scriptures as in the sciences. The latter pressed
me so much that he decided me at last to give to the public
the work I had kept for more than twenty-seven years.
Many illustrious men urged me, in the interest of mathematics,
to overcome my repugnance and to let the fruit of
my labours see the light. They assured me that the more
my theory of the motion of the earth appeared absurd, the
more it would be admired when the publication of my work
had dissipated doubts by the clearest demonstrations.
Yielding to these entreaties, and buoying myself with the
same hope, I consented to the printing of my work."</p>

<p>He tried to guard himself against the attacks of dogmatists
by saying, "If any evil-advised person should quote against
me any texts of Scripture, I deprecate such a rash attempt.
Mathematical truths can only be judged by mathematicians."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, however, his work, after his death,
was condemned by the Index in 1616, under Paul V.</p>

<p>On examining the ancient systems, Copernicus was struck
by the want of harmony in the arrangements proposed, and by
the arbitrary manner in which new principles were introduced
and old ones neglected, comparing the system to a collection
of legs and arms not united to any trunk, and it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
simplicity and harmony which the one idea of the motion of
the earth introduced into the whole system that convinced him
most thoroughly of its truth.</p>

<p>He knew well that new views and truths would appear as
paradoxes, and be rejected by men who were wedded to old
doctrines, and on this account he took such pains to show
that these views had been held before, and thus to disarm
them of their apparent novelty.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;The Copernican System.</span>
</div>

<p>Copernicus dealt only with the six planets then known and
the sun and moon. As to the stars, he had no idea that they
were suns like our own, at immense and various distances
from us. The knowledge of the magnitude of the sidereal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
universe was reserved for our own century, when it was
discovered by the method of parallaxes. We will give
Copernicus's own sketch of the planetary system:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the highest place is the sphere of the fixed stars, an
immovable sphere, which surrounds the whole of the universe.
Among the movable planets the first is Saturn, which requires
thirty years to make its revolution. After it Jupiter accomplishes
its journey in twelve years; Mars follows, requiring two
years. In the fourth line come the earth and the moon which in
the course of one year return to their original position. The
fifth place is occupied by Venus, which requires nine months
for its journey. Mercury occupies the sixth place, whose
orbit is accomplished in eighty days. In the midst of all
is the sun. What man is there, who in this majestic
temple could choose another and better place for that brilliant
lamp which illuminates all the planets with their satellites?
It is not without reason that the sun is called the lantern
of the world, the soul and thought of the universe. In
placing it in the centre of the planets, as on a regal throne,
we give it the government of the great family of celestial
bodies."</p>

<p>The hypothesis of the motion of the earth in its orbit
appeared simply to Copernicus as a good basis for the exact
determination of the ratios of the distances of the several
planets about the sun. But he did not give up the excentrics
and epicycles for the explanation of the irregular motions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the planets, and certain imaginary variations in the precession
of the equinoxes and the obliquity of the ecliptic.
According to him the earth was endowed with three
different motions, the first about its axis, the second along
the ecliptic, and a third, which he called the declination,
moving it backwards along the signs of the zodiac from east
to west. This last motion was invented to explain the
phenomena of the seasons. He thought, like many other
ancient philosophers, that a body could not turn about
another without being fixed in some way to it&mdash;by a crystal
sphere, or something&mdash;and in this case that the same surface
would each day be presented to the sun, and so it requires a
third rotation, by which its axis may remain constantly
parallel to itself. Galileo, however, afterwards demonstrated
the independence of the two motions in question, and proved
that the third was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Copernicus was born in the Polish village of Thorn, in 1473,
and died in 1543, at Warmia, of which he was canon, and
where he built an observatory. The voyages of his youth, his
labours, adversities, and old age at last broke him down, and
in the winter of 1542 he took to his bed, and was incapable
of further work. His work, which was just finished printing
at Nuremberg, was brought to him by his friends before he
died. He soon after completely failed in strength, and passed
away tranquilly on the 23rd of May, 1543.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The Copernican system required, however, establishing in
the minds of astronomers generally before it took the
place it now holds, and this work was done by Galileo&mdash;a
name as celebrated as that of Copernicus himself, if not
more so. This perhaps is due not only to his demonstration
of the motion of the earth, but to his introduction of
experimental philosophy, and his observational method in
astronomy.</p>

<p>The next advance was made by Kepler, who overthrew at
one blow all the excentrics and epicycles of the ancients,
when by his laborious calculations he proved the ellipticity
of the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>The Grecian hypotheses were the logical consequences of
two propositions which were universally admitted as axioms
in the early and middle ages. First, that the motions of the
heavenly bodies were uniform; second, that their orbits
were perfect circles. Nothing appeared more natural than
this belief, though false. So then when Kepler, in 1609,
recognised the fact, by incontestable geometrical measurements,
that Mars described an oval orbit round the sun, in
which its velocity varied periodically, he could not believe
either his observation or his calculation, and he puzzled his
brain to discover what secret principle it was that forced the
planet to approach and depart from the sun by turns.
Fortunately for him, in this inquietude he came across a
treatise by Gilbert, <i>De Magnate</i>, which had been published in
London nine years before. In this remarkable work Gilbert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
proved by experiment that the earth acts on magnetized
needles and on bars of iron placed near its surface just as a
magnet does&mdash;and by a conjectural extension of this fact,
which was a vague presentiment of the truth, he supposed
that the earth itself might be retained in its constant orbit
round the sun by a magnetic attraction. This idea was a
ray of light to Kepler. It led him to see the secret cause of
the alternating motions that had troubled him so much, and
in the joy of that discovery he said, "If we find it impossible
to attribute the vibration to a magnetic power residing in
the sun, acting on the planet without any material medium
between, we must conclude that the planet is itself endowed
with a kind of intelligent perception which gives it power to
know at each instant the proper angles and distances for its
motion." In the result Kepler was led to enunciate to the
world his three celebrated laws:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the planets move in ellipses, of which the sun is
in one of the foci.</p>

<p>2nd. The spaces described by the ideal radius which joins
each planet to the sun are proportional to the times of their
description. In other words, the nearer a planet is to the
sun, the faster it moves.</p>

<p>3rd. The squares of the times of revolution are as the
cubes of the major axes of the orbits.</p>

<p>Such were the laws of Kepler, the basis of modern
astronomy, which led in the hands of Newton to the simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
explanation by universal gravitation, which itself is now
asking to be explained.</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that the system of Copernicus
was universally accepted even by astronomers of note. By
some an attempt was made to invent a system which should
have all the advantages of this, and yet if possible save
the immobility of the earth. Such was that of Tycho Brahe,
who was born three years after the death of Copernicus,
and died in 1601. He was one of the most laborious
and painstaking observers of his time, although by the
peculiarity of fate he is known generally only by his false
system.</p>

<p>In 1577, Tycho Brahe wrote a little treatise, <i>Tychonis Brahe,
Dani, De Mundi &AElig;therei Recentioribus phenomenis, &agrave; propos</i>
of a comet that had lately appeared. He speaks at length of
his system as follows:&mdash;"I have remarked that the ancient
system of Ptolemy is not at all natural, and too complicated.
But neither can I approve of the new one introduced by
the great Copernicus after the example of Aristarchus of
Samos. This heavy mass of earth, so little fit for motion,
could not be displaced in this manner, and moved in three
ways, like the celestial bodies, without a shock to the principles
of physics. Besides, it is opposed to Scripture! I think then,"
he adds, "that we must decidedly and without doubt place
the earth immovable in the centre of world, according to
the belief of the ancients and the testimony of Scripture.
In my opinion the celestial motions are arranged in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Tycho Brahe&#39;s System.</span>
</div>

<p>way that the sun, the moon, and the sphere of the fixed
stars, which incloses all, have the earth for their centre.
The five planets turn about the sun as about their chief
and king, the sun being constantly in the centre of their
orbits, and accompany it in its annual motion round the
earth." This system perfectly accounts for the apparent
motions of the planets as seen from the earth, and is essentially
a variation on the Copernican, rather than on the
Ptolemaic system, but it lent itself less readily to future
discoveries. It simply amounts, as far as the solar system is
concerned, to impressing upon all the rest of it the motions
of the earth, so as to leave the latter at rest; and were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sun only as large with respect to the earth as it seems, were
the planets really smaller than the moon, and the stars only
at a short distance, and smaller than the planets, it might seem
more natural that they should move than the earth; but when
all these suppositions were disproved, the very argument of
Tycho Brahe for the stability of the earth turned the other way,
and proved as incontestably that it moved. In the Copernican
system, however, these questions are of no consequence; if
the sun be at rest, this mass makes no difference; if the earth
moves like the planets, their relative size does not alter
anything; and if stars are immovable they may be at any
distance and of any magnitude.</p>

<p>The objections of Tycho Brahe to the earth's motion were:
First, that it was too heavy&mdash;we know now, however, that
some other planets are heavier&mdash;and that the sun, which he
would make move instead, is 340,000 times as heavy.
Secondly, that if the earth moved, all loose things would be
carried from east to west; but we have experience of many
loose things being kept by friction on moving bodies, and
can conceive how, all things may be kept by the attraction of
the earth under the influence of its own motion. Thirdly,
that he could not imagine that the earth was turned upside
down every day, and that for twelve hours our heads are
downwards.</p>

<p>But the existence of the antipodes overcomes this objection,
and shows that there is no up and down in the universe, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
each man calls that <i>down</i> which is nearer to the centre of the
earth than himself.</p>

<p>A variation on Tycho Brahe's system was attempted by
one Longomontanus, who had lived with him for ten years.
It consisted in admitting the diurnal rotation, but not the
annual revolution, of the earth; but it made no progress, and
was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>More remarkable than this was the attempt by Descartes
in the same direction, namely, to hold the principles of
Copernicus, and yet to teach the immobility of the earth.
His idea of immobility was however very different from that
of Tycho Brahe, or of any one else, and would only be called
so by those who were bound to believe it at all costs.</p>

<p>His Theory of Vortices, as it is called, will be best given
in his own words as contained in his <i>Les Principes de la
Philosophie</i>, third part, chap. xxvi., entitled, "That the earth
is at rest in its heaven, which does not prevent its being
carried along with it, and that it is the same with all the
planets."</p>

<p>"I adhere," he says, "to the hypothesis of Copernicus,
because it seems to me the simplest and clearest. There is no
vacuum anywhere in space.... The heavens are full of a
universal liquid substance. This is an opinion now commonly
received among astronomers, because they cannot see how the
phenomena can be explained without it. The substance of
the heavens has the common property of all liquids, that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
minutest particles are easily moved in any direction, and
when it happens that they all move in one way, they
necessarily carry with them all the bodies they surround,
and which are not prevented from moving by any external
cause. The matter of the heaven in which the planets are
turns round continually like a vortex, which has the Sun for
its centre. The parts that are nearest the Sun move faster
than those that are at a greater distance; and all the planets,
including the earth, remain always suspended in the same
place in the matter of the heaven. And just as in the turns
of rivers, when the water turns back on itself and twists
round in circles, if any twig or light body floats on it, we see
it carry them round, and make them move with it, and even
among these twigs we may see some turning on their own
centre, and those that are nearest to the middle of the
vortex moving quicker than those on the outside; so we may
easily imagine it to be with the planets, and this is all that is
necessary to explain the phenomena. The matter that is round
Saturn takes about thirty years to run its circle; that which
surrounds Jupiter carries it and its satellites round in twelve
years, and so on.... The satellites are carried round their
primaries by smaller vortices.... The earth is not sustained
by columns, nor suspended in the air by ropes, but it is environed
on all sides by a very liquid heaven. It is at rest, and
has no propulsion or motion, since we do not perceive any in it.
This does not prevent it being carried round by its heaven, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
following its motion without moving itself, just as a vessel
which is not moved by winds or oars, and is not retained by
anchors, remains in repose in the middle of the sea, although
the flood of the great mass of water carries it insensibly
with it. Like the earth, the planets remain at rest in the
region of heaven where each one is found. Copernicus made
no difficulty in allowing that the earth moves. Tycho, to
whom this opinion seemed absurd and unworthy of common
sense, wished to correct him, but the earth has far more
motion in his hypothesis than in that of Copernicus."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Such is the celebrated theory of vortices. The comparison
of the rotation of the earth and planets and their revolution
round the sun to the turning of small portions of a rapid
stream, may contain an idea yet destined to be developed
to account for these motions; but as used by Descartes it
is a mere playing upon words admirably adapted to
secure the concurrence of all parties; those who believed in
the motion of the earth seeing that it did not interfere with
their ideas in the least, and those who believed in its stability
being gratified to find some way by which they might still
cling to that belief and yet adopt the new ideas. This was
its purpose, and that purpose it well served; but as a
philosophical speculation it was worthless. When former
astronomers declared that any planet moved, whether it were
the earth or any other, they had no idea of attraction, but
supposed the planet fixed to a sphere; this sphere moving
and carrying the planet with it was what they meant by the
planet moving: the theory of vortices merely substituted a
liquid for a solid sphere, with this disadvantage, that if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
planet were fixed to a solid moving sphere, it <i>must</i> move;
if only placed in a liquid one, that liquid might pass it if it
did not have motion of its own.</p>

<p>A variation on Descartes' system of vortices was proposed
in the eighteenth century, which supposed that the sun,
instead of being fixed in the centre of the system, itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
circulated round another centre, carrying Mercury with it.
This motion of the sun was intented to explain the changes
of magnitude of its disc as seen from the earth, and the
diurnal and annual variations in its motion, without discarding
its circular path.</p>

<p>We have thus noticed all the chief astronomical systems
that have at any time been entertained by astronomers. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
one and all have given way before the universally acknowledged
truth about which there is no longer any dispute.
Systems are not now matters of opinion or theory. We
speak of facts as certain as any that can be ascertained in
any branch of knowledge. We have much to learn, but
what we have settled as the basis of our knowledge will
never more be altered as far as we can see.</p>

<p>Of course there have been always fantastic fancies put
forth about the solar system, but they are more amusing
than instructive. Some have said that there is no sun, moon,
or stars, but that they are reflections from an immense light
under the earth. Some savage races say that the moon when
decreasing breaks up into stars, and is renewed each month
by a creative act. The Indians used to say that it was full
of nectar which the gods ate up when it waned, and which
grew again when it waxed. The Brahmins placed the earth
in the centre, and said that the stars moved like fishes in a
sea of liquid. They counted nine planets, of which two are
invisible dragons which cause eclipses; which, since they
happen in various parts of the zodiac, show that these
dragons revolve like the rest. They said the sun was nearer
than the moon, perhaps because it is hotter and brighter.
Berosus the Chaldean gave a very original explanation of the
phases and eclipses of the moon. He said it had one side
bright, and the other side just the colour of the sky, and in
turning it represented the different colours to us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter we may notice what information
we possess as to the origin of the names by which the
planets are known. These names have not always been given
to them, and date only from the time when the poets began
to associate the Grecian mythology with astronomy. The
earlier names had reference rather to their several characters,
although there appear to have been among every people two
sets of names applied to them.</p>

<p>The earliest Greek names referred to their various degrees of
brilliancy: thus Saturn, which is not easily distinguished, was
called Phenon, or <i>that which appears</i>; Jupiter was named
Pha&euml;ton, <i>the brilliant</i>; Mars was Pyso&iuml;s, or <i>flame-coloured</i>;
Mercury, Stilbon, <i>the sparkling</i>; Venus, Phosphorus; and
Lucifer, <i>the light-bearer</i>. They called the latter also Calliste,
<i>the most beautiful</i>. It was also known then as now under the
appellations of the morning star and evening star, indicating
its special position.</p>

<p>With the ancient Accadians, the planets had similar names,
among others. Thus, "Mars was sometimes called <i>the vanishing
star</i>, in allusion to its recession from the earth, and Jupiter
the <i>planet of the ecliptic</i>, from its neighbourhood to the latter"
(Sayce). The name of Mars raises the interesting question
as to whether they had noticed its phases as well as its
movements&mdash;especially when, with reference to Venus, it is
recorded in the "Observations of Bel," that "it rises, and in its
orbit duly grows in size." They had also a rather confusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
system of nomenclature by naming each planet after the star
that it happened to be the nearest to at any point of its
course round the ecliptic.</p>

<p>Among less cultivated nations also the same practice held,
as with the natives of South America, whose name for the
sun is a word meaning <i>it brings the day</i>; for the moon, <i>it
brings the night</i>; and for Venus, <i>it announces the day</i>.</p>

<p>But even among the Eastern nations, from whom the
Greeks and Romans borrowed their astronomical systems, it
soon became a practice to associate these planets with the
names of the several divinities they worshipped. This was
perhaps natural from the adoration they paid to the celestial
luminaries themselves on account of their real or supposed
influence on terrestrial affairs; and, moreover, as time went on,
and heroes had appeared, and they had to find them dwelling-places
in the heavens, they would naturally associate them
with one or other of the most brilliant and remarkable
luminaries, to which they might suppose them translated.
Beyond these general remarks, only conjectures can be made
why any particular divinity should among the Greeks be
connected with the several planets as we now know them.
Such conjectures as the following we may make. Thus
Jupiter, the largest, would take first rank, and be called after
the name of the chief divinity. The soft and sympathising
Venus&mdash;appearing at the twilight&mdash;would well denote the
evening star. Mars would receive its name from its red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
appearance, naturally suggesting carnage and the god of
war. Saturn, or Kronos, the god of time, is personified by
the slow and almost imperceptible motion of that remote
planet. While Mercury, the fiery and quick god of thieves
and commerce, is well matched with the hide-and-seek planet
which so seldom can be seen, and moves so rapidly.</p>

<p>These were the only planets known to the ancients, and
were indeed all that could be discovered without a telescope.
If the ancient Babylonians possessed telescopes, as has been
conjectured from their speaking, as we have noticed above,
of the increase of the size of Venus, and from the finding a
crystal lens among the ruins of Nineveh, they did not use
them for this purpose.</p>

<p>The other planets now known have a far shorter history.
Uranus was discovered by Sir William Herschel on the
13th of March, 1781, and was at first taken for a comet.
Herschel proposed to call it Georgium Sidus, after King
George III. Lalande suggested it should be named Herschel,
after its discoverer, and it bore this name for some time.
Afterwards the names, Neptune, Astr&#339;a, Cybele, and Uranus
were successively proposed, and the latter, the suggestion of
Bode, was ultimately adopted. It is the name of the most
ancient of the gods, connected with the then most modern of
planets in point of discovery, though also most ancient in
formation, if recent theories be correct. Neptune, as everybody
knows, was calculated into existence, if one may so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
speak, by Adams and Leverrier independently, and was first
seen, in the quarter indicated, by Dr. Galle at Berlin, in
September, 1846, and by universal consent it received the
name it now bears.</p>

<p>There are now also known a long series of what are
called minor planets, all circulating between Mars and
Jupiter, with their irregular orbits inextricably mingled
together. Their discovery was led to in a remarkable
manner. It was observed that the distances of the several
planets might approximately be expressed by the terms of
a certain mathematical series, if one term was supplied
between Mars and Jupiter&mdash;a fact known by the name of
Bode's law. When the new planet, Uranus, was found to
obey this law, the feeling was so strong that there must be
something to represent this missing term, that strong efforts
were made to discover it, which led to success, and several,
whose names are derived from the minor gods and goddesses,
are now well known.</p>

<p>All these planets, like the signs of the zodiac, are indicated
by astronomers by certain symbols, which, as they derive
their form from the names or nature of the planets, may
properly here be explained. The sign of Neptune is <span class="symsign">&#9798;</span>, representing
the trident of the sea; for Uranus <span class="symsign">&#9797;</span>, which is the
first letter of Herschel with a little globe below; <span class="symsign">&#9796;</span> is the
sickle of time, or Saturn;
<span class="symsign">&#9795;</span> is the representation of the first letter of Zeus or Jupiter;

<p>The more modern discoveries have, of course, been all
made by means of the telescope, and a few words on the
history of its discovery may fitly close this chapter.</p>

<p>According to Olbers, a concave and convex lens were first
used in combination, to render objects less distant in appearance,
in the year 1606. In that year the children of one
Jean Lippershey, an optician of Middelburg, in Zealand, were
playing with his lenses, and happened to hold one before the
other to look at a distant clock. Their great surprise in
seeing how near it seemed attracted their father's attention,
and he made several experiments with them, at last fixing
them as in the modern telescope&mdash;in draw tubes. On the
2nd of October, 1606, he made a petition to the States-General
of Holland for a patent. The aldermen, however, saw no
advantage in it, as you could only look with one eye instead
of two. They refused the patent, and though the discovery
was soon found of value, Lippershey reaped no benefit.</p>

<p>Galileo was the first to apply the telescope to astronomical
observations. He did not have it made in Holland, but
constructed it himself on Lippershey's principle. This was
in 1609. Its magnifying power was at first 4, and he
afterwards increased it to 7, and then to 30. With this he
discovered the phases of Venus, the spots on the sun, the
four satellites of Jupiter, and the mountains of the moon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Plate X.&mdash;The Discovery of the Telescope.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Kepler, in 1611, made the first astronomical telescope with
two concave glasses.</p>

<p>Huyghens increased the magnifying power successively to
48, 50, and 92, and discovered Saturn's ring and his satellite
No. 4.</p>

<p>Cassini, the first director of the Paris Observatory, brought
it to 150, aided by Auzout Campani of Rome, and Rives of
London. He observed the rotation of Jupiter (1665), that
of Venus and Mars (1666), the fifth and third satellites of
Saturn (1671), and afterwards the two nearer ones (1684);
the other satellites of this planet were discovered, the sixth
and seventh, by Sir William Herschel (1789), and the eighth
by Bond and Lasel (1848).</p>

<p>We may add here that the satellites of Uranus were
discovered, six by Herschel from 1790 to 1794, and two by
Lassel in 1851, the latter also discovering Neptune's satellite
in 1847.</p>

<p>The rotation of Saturn was discovered by Herschel in
1789, and that of Mercury by Schr&#339;ter in 1800.</p>

<p>The earliest telescopes which were reflectors were made
by Gregory in 1663 and Newton in 1672. The greatest
instruments of our century are that of Herschel, which
magnifies 3,000 times, and Lord Rosse's, magnifying 6,000
times, the Foucault telescope at Marseilles, of 4,000, the reflector
at Melbourne, of 7,000, and the Newall refractor.</p>

<p>The exact knowledge of the heavens, which makes so grand
a feature in modern science, is due, however, not only to the
existence of instruments, but also to the establishment of
observatories especially devoted to their use. The first astronomical
observatory that was constructed was that at Paris.
In 1667 Colbert submitted the designs of it to Louis XIV.,
and four years afterwards it was completed. The Greenwich
Observatory was established in 1676, that of Berlin in 1710,
and that of St. Petersburg in 1725. Since then numerous
others have been erected, private as well as public, in all
parts of the world, and no night passes without numerous
observations being taken as part of the ordinary duty of
the astronomers attached to them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE TERRESTRIAL WORLD OF THE ANCIENTS.&mdash;COSMOGRAPHY
AND GEOGRAPHY.</h3>


<p>With respect to the shape and position of the earth itself in
the material universe, and the question of its motion or
immobility, we cannot go so far back as in the case of the
heavens, since it obviously requires more observation, and
is not so pressing for an answer.</p>

<p>Amongst the Greeks several authors appear to have undertaken
the subject, but only one complete work has come
down to us which undertakes it directly. This is a work
attributed to Aristotle, <i>De Mundo</i>. It is addressed to
Alexander, and by some is considered to be spurious, because
it lacks the majestic obscurity that in his acknowledged
works repels the reader. Although, however, it is not as
obscure as it might be, for the writer, it is quite bad enough,
and its dryness and vagueness, its mixture of metaphysical
and physical reasoning, logic and observation, and the change
that has naturally passed over the meanings of many common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
words since they were written, render it very tedious and
unpleasant reading.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as presenting us with the first recorded ideas
on these questions of the nature and properties of the earth,
it deserves attentive study. It is not a system of observations
like those of Ptolemy and the Alexandrian School,
but an entirely theoretical work. It is founded entirely on
logic; but unfortunately, if the premisses are bad, the better
the syllogism the more erroneous will be the conclusion; and
it is just this which we find here. Thus if he be asked
whether the earth turns or the heavens, he will reply that the
earth is <i>evidently</i> in repose, and that this is the case not only
because we observe it to be so, but because it is a necessity
that it should be; because repose is <i>natural</i> to the earth, and
it is <i>naturally</i> in equilibrium. This idea of "natural" leads
very often astray. He is guided to his idea of what is
natural by seeing what is, and then argues that what is, or
appears to be, must be, because it is natural&mdash;thus arguing in
a circle. Another example may be given in his answer to
the question, Why must the stars move round the earth? He
says it is natural, because a circle is a more perfect line, and
must therefore be described by the perfect stars, and a circle
is perfect because it has no ends! Unfortunately there are
other curves that have no ends; but the circle was considered,
without more reason, the most perfect curve, and therefore
the planets must move in circles&mdash;an idea which had to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
till Kepler's time to be exploded. One more specimen of
this style may be quoted, namely, his proof that every part
of heaven must be eternally moving, while the earth must be
in the centre and at rest. The proof is this. Everything
which performs any act has been made for the purpose of that
act. Now the work of God is immortality, from which it
follows that all that is divine must have an eternal motion.
But the heavens have a divine quality, and for this reason
they have a spherical shape and move eternally in a circle.
Now when a body has a circular motion, one part of it must
remain at rest in its place, namely, that which is in the
centre; the earth is in the centre&mdash;therefore it is at rest.</p>

<p>Aristotle says in this work that there are two kinds of
simple motion, that in a circle and that in a straight line.
The latter belongs to the elements, which either go up or
down, and the former to the celestial bodies, whose nature is
more divine, and which have never been known to change;
and the earth and world must be the only bodies in existence,
for if there were another, it must be the contrary to this, and
there is no contrary to a circle; and again, if there were any
other body, the earth would be attracted towards it, and
move, which it does not. Such is the style of argument
which was in those days thought conclusive, and which with
a little development and inflation of language appeared
intensely profound.</p>

<p>But what brings these speculations to the subject we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
now in hand is this: that when Aristotle thus proves the
earth to be immovable in the centre of the universe, he
is led on to inquire how it is possible for it to remain
in one fixed place. He observed that even a small fragment
of earth, when it is raised into the air and then let go, immediately
falls without ever stopping in one place&mdash;falling,
as he supposed, all the quicker according to its weight; and
he was therefore puzzled to know why the whole mass of
the earth, notwithstanding its weight, could be kept from
falling.</p>

<p>Aristotle examines one by one the answers that have been
given to this question. Thus Xenophanes gave to the earth
infinitely extended roots, against which Empedocles uses such
arguments as we should use now. Thales of Miletus makes
the earth rest upon water, without finding anything on which
the water itself can rest, or answering the question how it is
that the heavier earth can be supported on the lighter water.
Anaxemenes, Anaxagoras, and Democritus, who make the
earth flat, consider it to be sustained by the air, which is
accumulated below it, and also presses down upon it like a
great coverlet. Aristotle himself says that he agrees with
those philosophers who think that the earth is brought to the
centre by the primitive rotation of things, and that we may
compare it, as Empedocles does, to the water in glasses which
are made to turn rapidly, and which does not fall out or move,
even though upside down. He also quotes with approval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
another opinion somewhat similar to this, namely, that of
Anaximander, which states that the earth is in repose, on
account of its own equilibrium. Placed in the centre and
at an equal distance from its extremities, there is no reason
why it should move in one direction rather than the other,
and rests immovable in the centre without being able to
leave it.</p>

<p>The result of all is that Aristotle concludes that the
earth is immovable, in the centre of the universe, and that
it is not a star circulating in space like other stars, and that
it does not rotate upon its axis; and he completes the system
by stating that the earth is spherical, which is proved by the
different aspects of the heavens to a voyager to the north or
to the south.</p>

<p>Such was the Aristotelian system, containing far more
error than truth, which was the first of any completeness.
Scattered ideas, however, on the shape and method of support
of the earth and the cause of various phenomena, such
as the circulation of the stars, are met with besides in
abundance.</p>

<p>The original ideas of the earth were naturally tinged by
the prepossessions of each race, every one thinking his own
country to be situated in the centre. Thus among the Hindoos,
who lived near the equator, and among the Scandinavians,
inhabiting regions nearer the pole, the same meaning attaches
to the words by which they express their own country,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>medpiama</i> and <i>medgard</i>, both meaning the central habitation.
Olympus among the Greeks was made the centre of the
earth, and afterwards the temple of Delphi. For the Egyptians
the central point was Thebes; for the Assyrians it was
Babylon; for the Indians it was the mountain Mero; for
the Hebrews Jerusalem. The Chinese always called their
country the central empire. It was then the custom to
denote the world by a large disc, surrounded on all sides by
a marvellous and inaccessible ocean. At the extremities of
the earth were placed imaginary regions and fortunate isles,
inhabited by giants or pigmies. The vault of the sky was
supposed to be supported by enormous mountains and
mysterious columns.</p>

<p>Numerous variations have been suggested on the earliest
supposed form of the earth, which was, as we have seen in a
former chapter, originally supposed to be an immense flat of
infinite depth, and giving support to the heavens.</p>

<p>As travels extended and geography began to be a science,
it was remarked that an immense area of water circumscribed
the solid earth by irregular boundaries&mdash;whence the idea of
a universal ocean.</p>

<p>When, however, it was perceived that the horizon at sea
was always circular, it was supposed that the ocean was
bounded, and the whole earth came to be represented as
contained in a circle, beneath which were roots reaching
downwards without end, but with no imagined support.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vedic priests asserted that the earth was supported
on twelve columns, which they very ingeniously turned to
their own account by asserting that these columns were
supported by virtue of the sacrifices that were made to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
gods, so that if these were not made the earth would
collapse.</p>

<p>These pillars were invented in order to account for the
passing of the sun beneath the earth after his setting, for
which at first they were obliged to imagine a system of
tunnels, which gradually became enlarged to the intervals
between the pillars.</p>

<p>The Hindoos made the hemispherical earth to be supported
upon four elephants, and the four elephants to stand on the
back of an immense tortoise, which itself floated on the surface
of a universal ocean. We are not however to laugh at
this as intended to be literal; the elephants symbolised, it
may be, the four elements, or the four directions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
compass, and the tortoise was the symbol for strength and
for eternity, which was also sometimes represented by a
serpent.</p>

<p>The floating of the earth on water or some other liquid long
held ground. It was adopted by Thales, and six centuries
later Seneca adopts the same opinion, saying that the humid
element that supports the earth's disc like a vessel may be
either the ocean or some liquid more simple than water.</p>

<p>Diodorus tells us that the Chaldeans considered the earth
hollow and boat-shaped&mdash;perhaps turned upside down&mdash;and
this doctrine was introduced into Greece by Heraclitus of
Ephesus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;The Earth of Anaximander.</span>
</div>

<p>Anaximander represents the earth as a cylinder, the upper
face of which alone is inhabited. This cylinder, he states, is
one-third as high as its diameter, and it floats freely in the
centre of the celestial vault, because there is no reason why
it should move to one side rather than the other. Leucippus,
Democritus, Heraclitus, and Anaxagoras all adopted this
purely imaginary form. Europe made the northern half, and
Lybia (Africa) and Asia the southern, while Delphi was in
the centre.</p>

<p>Anaximenes, without giving a precise opinion as to the
form of the earth, made it out to be supported on compressed
air, though he gave no idea as to how the air was to be
compressed.</p>

<p>Plato thought to improve upon these ideas by making the
earth cubical. The cube, which is bound by six equal faces,
appeared to him the most perfect of solids, and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
most suitable for the earth, which was to stand in the centre
of the universe.</p>

<p>Eudoxus, who in his long voyages throughout Greece and
Egypt had seen new constellations appear as he went south,
while others to the north disappeared, deduced the sphericity
of the earth, in which opinion he was followed by Archimedes,
and, as we have seen, by Aristotle.</p>

<p>According to Achilles Tatius, Xenophanes gave to the
earth the shape of an immense inclined plane, which stretched
out to infinity. He drew it in the form of a vast mountain.
The summit only was inhabited by men, and round it circulated
the stars, and the base was at an infinite depth. Hesiod<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
had before this obscurely said: "The abyss is surrounded by
a brazen barrier; above it rest the roots of the earth."
Epicurus and his school were well pleased with this representation.
If such were the foundations of the earth, then it
was impossible that the sun, and moon, and stars should
complete their revolutions beneath it. A solid and indefinite
support being once admitted, the Epicurean ideas about the
stars were a necessary consequence; the stars must inevitably
be put out each day in the west, since they are not seen to
return to the place whence they started, and they must be
rekindled some hours afterwards in the east. In the days of
Augustus, Cleomedes still finds himself obliged to combat
these Epicurean ideas about the setting and rising of the sun
and stars. "These stupid ideas," he says, "have no other
foundation than an old woman's story&mdash;that the Iberians
hear each night the hissing noise made by the burning sun as
it is extinguished, like a hot iron in the waters of the ocean."
Modern travellers have shown us that similar ideas about
the support of the earth have been entertained by more
remote people. Thus, in the opinion of the Greenlanders,
handed down from antiquity to our own days, the earth is
supported on pillars, which are so consumed by time that
they often crack, and were it not that they are supported by
the incantations of the magicians, they would long since have
broken down. This idea of the breaking of the pillars may
possibly have originated in the known sinking of the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
beneath the sea, which is still going on even at the present
day.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 31.&mdash;Egyptian Representation of the Earth.</span>
</div>

<p>An ancient Egyptian papyrus in the library of Paris gives
a very curious hieroglyphical representation of the universe.
The earth is here figured under the form of a reclining figure,
and is covered with leaves. The heavens are personified by
a goddess, which forms the vault by her star-bespangled
body, which is elongated in a very peculiar manner. Two
boats, carrying, one the rising sun, and the other the setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
sun, are represented as moving along the heavens over the
body of the goddess. In the centre of the picture is the
god, Maon, a divine intelligence, which presides over the
equilibrium of the universe.</p>

<p>We will now pass on from the early ideas of the general
shape and situation of the world to inquire into the first
outlines of geographical knowledge of details.</p>

<p>Of all the ancient writings which deal with such questions,
the Hebrew Scriptures have the greatest antiquity, and in
them are laid down many details of known countries, from
which a fair map of the world as known to them might be
made out. The prophet Esdras believed that six-sevenths
of the earth was dry land&mdash;an idea which could not well
be exploded till the great oceans had been traversed and
America discovered.</p>

<p>More interesting, as being more complete, and written to a
certain extent for the very purpose of relating what was
known of the geography of the earth, are the writings of the
oldest Grecian poets. The first elements of Grecian geography
are contained in the two national and almost sacred
poems, the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. So important have these
writings been considered in regard to ancient geography, that
for many centuries discussions have been carried on with
regard to the details, though evidently fictitious, of the
voyage of Ulysses, and twenty lines of the <i>Iliad</i> have
furnished matter for a book of thirty volumes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The shield of Achilles, forged by Vulcan and described in
the eighteenth book of the <i>Iliad</i>, gives us an authentic representation
of the primitive cosmographical ideas of the age.
The earth is there figured as a disc, surrounded on all sides
by the <i>River Ocean</i>. However strange it may appear to us,
to apply the term <i>river</i> to the ocean, it occurs too often in
Homer and the other ancient poets to admit of a doubt of
its being literally understood by them. Hesiod even describes
the sources of the ocean at the western extremity of the
world, and the representation of these sources was preserved
from age to age amongst authors posterior to Homer by
nearly a thousand years. Herodotus says plainly that the
geographers of his time drew their maps of the world
according to the same ideas; the earth was figured with
them as a round disc, and the ocean as a river, which washed
it on all sides.</p>

<p>The earth's disc, the <i>orbis terrarum</i>, was covered according
to Homer by a solid vault or firmament, beneath which the
stars of the day and night were carried by chariots supported
by the clouds. In the morning the sun rose from the eastern
ocean, and in the evening it declined into the western; and a
vessel of gold, the mysterious work of Vulcan, carried it
quickly back by the north, to the east again. Beneath the
earth Homer places, not the habitation of the dead, the
caverns of Hades, but a vault called Tartarus, corresponding
to the firmament. Here lived the Titans, the enemies of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
gods, and no breath of wind, no ray of light, ever penetrated
to this subterranean world. Writers subsequent to Homer
by a century determined even the height of the firmament
and the depth of Tartarus. An anvil, they said, would take
nine days to fall from heaven to earth, and as many more
to fall from earth to the bottom of Tartarus. This estimate
of the height of heaven was of course far too small. If a
body were to fall for nine days and nights, or 777,600 seconds
under the attraction of the earth, it would only pass over
430,500 miles, that is not much more than half as far again
as the moon. A ray of light would only take two seconds to
pass over that distance, whereas it takes eight minutes
to reach us from the sun, and four hours to come from
Neptune&mdash;to say nothing of the distance of the stars.</p>

<p>The limits of the world in the Homeric cosmography were
surrounded by obscurity. The columns of which Atlas was
the guardian were supported on unknown foundations, and
disappeared in the systems subsequent to Homer. Beyond
the mysterious boundary where the earth ended and the
heavens began an indefinite chaos spread out&mdash;a confused
medley of life and inanity, a gulf where all the elements of
heaven, Tartarus, and earth and sea are mixed together, a
gulf of which the gods themselves are afraid.</p>

<p>Ideas such as these prevailed long after geometers and
astronomers had proved the spherical form of the globe,
and they were revived by the early Christian geographers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and have left their trace even on the common language of
to-day.</p>

<p>The centre of the terrestrial disc was occupied by the
continent and isles of Greece, which in the time of Homer
possessed no general name. The centre of Greece passed
therefore for the centre of the whole world; and in Homer's
system it was reckoned to be Olympus in Thessaly, but the
priests of the celebrated Temple of Apollo at Delphi (known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
then under the name of Python) gave out a tradition that
that sacred place was the real centre of the habitable world.</p>

<p>The straits which separate Italy from Sicily were so to
speak the vestibule of the fabulous world of Homer. The
threefold ebb and flow, the howling of the monster Scylla,
the whirlpools of Charybdis, the floating rocks&mdash;all tell us
that we are quitting here the region of truth. Sicily itself,
although already known under the name of <i>Trinacria</i>, was
filled with marvels; here the flocks of the Sun wandered in
a charming solitude under the guardianship of nymphs; here
the Cyclops, with one eye only, and the anthropophagous
Lestrigons scared away the traveller from a land that was
otherwise fertile in corn and wine. Two historical races were
placed by Homer in Sicily, namely the <i>Sicani</i>, and the <i>Siceli</i>,
or <i>Siculi</i>.</p>

<p>To the west of Sicily we find ourselves in the midst of a
region of fables. The enchanted islands of Circe and Calypso,
and the floating island of Eolus can no longer be found,
unless we imagine them to have originated, like Graham's
Island in this century, from volcanic eruptions or elevations,
and to have disappeared again by the action of the sea.</p>

<p>The Homeric map of the world terminated towards the
west by two fabulous countries which have given rise to
many traditions among the ancients, and to many discussions
among moderns. Near to the entrance of the ocean, and not
far from the sombre caverns where the dead are congregated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Ulysses found the <i>Cimmerians</i>, "an unhappy people, who,
constantly surrounded by thick shadows, never enjoyed the
rays of the sun, neither when it mounted the skies, nor when
it descended below the earth." Still farther away, and in
the ocean itself, and therefore beyond the limits of the earth,
beyond the region of winds and seasons, the poet paints for
us a Fortunate Land, which he calls <i>Elysium</i>, a country where
tempests and winter are unknown, where a soft zephyr always
blows, and where the elect of Jupiter, snatched from the
common lot of mortals, enjoy a perpetual felicity.</p>

<p>Whether these fictions had an allegory for their basis, or
were founded on the mistaken notions of voyagers&mdash;whether
they arose in Greece, or, as the Hebrew etymology of the
name Cimmerian might seem to indicate, in the east, or in
Phenicia, it is certain that the images they present, transferred
to the world of reality, and applied successively to
various lands, and confused by contradictory explanations,
have singularly embarrassed the progress of geography through
many centuries. The Roman travellers thought they recognised
the Fortunate Isles in a group to the west of Africa,
now known as the Canaries. The philosophical fictions of
Plato and Theopompus about Atlantes and Meropis have
been long perpetuated in historical theories; though of course
it is possible that in the numerous changes that have taken
place in the surface of the earth, some ancient vast and
populous island may have descended beneath the level of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the sea. On the other side, the poetic imagination created the
<i>Hyperboreans</i>, beyond the regions where the northern winds
were generated, and according to a singular kind of meteorology,
they believed them for that reason to be protected from
the cold winds. Herodotus regrets that he has not been able
to discover the least trace of them; he took the trouble to
ask for information about them from their neighbours, the
<i>Arimaspes</i>, a very clear-sighted race, though having but a
single eye; but they could not inform him where the
Hyperboreans dwelt. The Enchanted Isles, where the Hesperides
used to guard the golden fruit, and which the whole
of antiquity placed in the west, not far from the Fortunate
Isles, are sometimes called Hyperborean by authors well
versed in the ancient traditions. It is also in this sense that
Sophocles speaks of the Garden of Ph&#339;bus, near the vault of
heaven, and not far from the <i>sources of the night</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of the
setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Avienus explains the mild temperature of the Hyperborean
country by the temporary proximity of the sun, since,
according to the Homeric ideas, it passes during the night
by the northern ocean to return to its palace in the east.
This ancient tradition was not entirely exploded in the time
of Tacitus, who states that on the confines of Germany might
be seen the veritable setting of Apollo beyond the water,
and he believes that as in the east the sun gives rise to
incense and balm by its great proximity to the earth, so in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the regions where it sets it makes the most precious of juices
to transude from the earth and form amber. It is this idea
that is embedded in the fables of amber being the tears of
gold that Apollo shed when he went to the Hyperborean land
to mourn the loss of his son &AElig;sculapius, or by the sisters of
Pha&euml;ton, changed into poplars; and it is denoted by the
Greek name for amber, <i>electron</i>&mdash;a sun-stone. The Grecian
sages, long before the time of Tacitus, said that this very
precious material was an exhalation from the earth that was
produced and hardened by the rays of the sun, which
they thought came nearer to the earth in the west and in
the north.</p>

<p>Florus, in relating the expedition of Decimus Brutus along
the coast of Spain, gives great effect to the Epicurean views
about the sun, by declaring that Brutus only stopped his conquests
after having witnessed the actual descent of the sun
into the ocean, and having heard with horror the terrible noise
occasioned by its extinction. The ancients also believed that
the sun and the other heavenly bodies were nourished by the
waters&mdash;partly the fresh water of the rivers, and partly the
salt water of the sea. Cleanthes gave the reason for the sun
returning towards the equator on reaching the solstices, that
it could not go too far away from the source of its nourishment.
Pytheas relates that in the Island of Thule, six days'
journey north of Great Britain, and in all that neighbourhood,
there was no land nor sea nor air, but a compound of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
three, on which the earth and the sea were suspended, and
which served to unite together all the parts of the universe,
though it was not possible to go into these places, neither on
foot nor in ships. Perhaps the ice floating in the frozen seas
and the hazy northern atmosphere had been seen by some
navigator, and thus gave rise to this idea. As it stands, the
history may be perhaps matched by that of the amusing
monk who said he had been to the end of the world and had
to stoop down, as there was not room to stand between
heaven and earth at their junction.</p>

<p>Homer lived in the tenth century before our era. Herodotus,
who lived in the fifth, developed the Homeric chart
to three times its size. He remarks at the commencement
of his book that for several centuries the world has been
divided into three parts&mdash;Europe, Asia, and Libya; the
names given to them being female. The exterior limits of
these countries remained in obscurity notwithstanding that
those boundaries of them that lay nearest to Greece were
clearly defined.</p>

<p>One of the greatest writers on ancient geography was
Strabo, whose ideas we will now give an account of. He
seems to have been a disciple of Hipparchus in astronomy,
though he criticises and contradicts him several times in
his geography. He had a just idea of the sphericity of the
earth; but considered it as the centre of the universe, and
immovable. He takes pains to prove that there is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
one inhabited earth&mdash;not in this refuting the notion that
the moon and stars might have inhabitants, for these he
considered to be insignificant meteors nourished by the
exhalations of the ocean; but he fought against the fact
of there being on this globe any other inhabited part than
that known to the ancients.</p>

<p>It is remarkable to notice that the proofs then used by
geographers of the sphericity of the earth are just those
which we should use now. Thus Strabo says, "The indirect
proof is drawn from the centripetal force in general,
and the tendency that all bodies have in particular towards
a centre of gravity. The direct proof results from the
phenomena observed on the sea and in the sky. It is
evident, for example, that it is the curvature of the earth
that alone prevents the sailor from seeing at a distance the
lights that are placed at the ordinary height of the eye,
and which must be placed a little higher to become visible
even at a greater distance; in the same way, if the eye is
a little raised it will see things which previously were
hidden." Homer had already made the same remark.</p>

<p>On this globe, representing the world, Strabo and the
cosmographers of his time placed the habitable world in a
surface which he describes in the following way: "Suppose
a great circle, perpendicular to the equator, and passing
through the poles to be described about the sphere. It is
plain that the surface will be divided by this circle, and by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
equator into four equal parts. The northern and southern
hemispheres contain, each of them, two of these parts.
Now on any one of these quarters of the sphere let us trace
a quadrilateral which shall have for its southern boundary
the half of the equator, for northern boundary a circle marking
the commencement of polar cold, and for the other
sides two equal and opposite segments of the circle that
passes through the poles. It is on one such quadrilateral
that the habitable world is placed." He figures it as an
island, because it is surrounded on all sides by the sea.
It is plain that Strabo had a good idea of the nature of
gravity, because he does not distinguish in any way an
upper or a lower hemisphere, and declares that the quadrilateral
on which the habitable world is situated may be any
one of the four formed in this way.</p>

<p>The form of the habitable world is that of a "chlamys," or
cloak. This follows, he says, both from geometry and the great
spread of the sea, which, enveloping the land, covers it both
to the east and to the west and reduces it to a shortened
and truncated form of such a figure that its greatest breadth
preserved has only a third of its length. As to the
actual length and breadth, he says, "it measures seventy
thousand stadia in length, and is bounded by a sea whose
immensity and solitude renders it impassable; while the
breadth is less than thirty thousand stadia, and has for
boundaries the double region where the excess of heat on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
one side and the excess of cold on the other render it
uninhabitable."</p>

<p>The habitable world was thus much longer from east to
west than it was broad from north to south; from whence
come our terms <i>longitude</i>, whose degrees are counted in
the former direction, and <i>latitude</i>, reckoned in the latter
direction.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes, and after him Hipparchus, while he gives
larger numbers than the preceding for the dimensions of the
inhabited part of the earth, namely, thirty-eight thousand
stadia of breadth and eighty thousand of length, declares
that physical laws accord with calculations to prove that
the length of the habitable earth must be taken from the
rising to the setting of the sun. This length extends from
the extremity of India to that of Iberia, and the breadth
from the parallel of Ethiopia to that of Ierne.</p>

<p>That the earth is an island, Strabo considers to be
proved by the testimony of our senses. For wherever men
have reached to the extremities of the earth they have
found the sea, and for regions where this has not been
verified it is established by reasoning. Those who have
retraced their steps have not done so because their passage
was barred by any continent, but because their supplies
have run short, and they were afraid of the solitude; the
water always ran freely in front of them.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that Strabo and the astronomers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
that age, who recognised so clearly the sphericity of the
earth and the real insignificance of mountains, should yet
have supposed the stars to have played so humble a part,
but so it was; and we find Strabo arguing in what we may
call quite the contrary direction. He says, "the larger the
mass of water that is spread round the earth, so much more
easy is it to conceive how the vapours arising from it are
sufficient to nourish the heavenly bodies."</p>

<p>Among the Latin cosmographers we may here cite one
who flourished in the first century after Christ, Pomponius
Mela, who wrote a treatise, called <i>De Situ Orbis</i>. From whatever
source, whether traditional or otherwise, he arrived at
the conclusion, he divided the earth into two continents,
our own and that of the Antichthones, which reached to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
antipodes. This map was in use till the time of Christopher
Columbus, who modified it in the matter of the position of
this second continent, which till then remained a matter of
mystery.</p>

<p>Of those who in ancient times added to the knowledge
then possessed of cosmography, we should not omit to
mention the name of Pytheas, of Marseilles, who flourished
in the fourth century before our era. His chief observations,
however, were not so closely related to geography as to the
relation of the earth with the heavenly bodies. By the observation
of the gnomon at mid-day on the day of the solstice
he determined the obliquity of the ecliptic in his epoch. By
the observation of the height of the pole, he discovered that
in his time it was not marked by any star, but formed a
quadrilateral with three neighbouring stars, &#946; of the little
Bear and &#954; and &#945; of the Dragon.</p>

<h3>COSMOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE CHURCH.</h3>


<p>After the writers mentioned in the last chapter a long
interval elapsed without any progress being made in the
knowledge of the shape or configuration of the earth. From
the fall of the Roman Empire, whose colonies themselves
gave a certain knowledge of geography, down to the
fifteenth century, when the great impetus was given to
discovery by the adventurous voyagers of Spain and Portugal,
there was nothing but servile copying from ancient authors,
who were even misrepresented when they were not understood.
Even the peninsula of India was only known by the
accounts of Orientals and the writings of the Ancients until
the beginning of the fifteenth century. Vague notions, too,
were held as to the limits of Africa, and even of Europe
and Asia&mdash;while of course they knew nothing of America,
in spite of their marking on their maps an antichthonal
continent to the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Denys, the traveller, a Greek writer of the first century,
and Priscian, his Latin commentator of the fourth, still
maintained the old errors with regard to the earth. According
to them the earth is not round, but leaf-shaped; its
boundaries are not so arranged as to form everywhere a
regular circle. Macrobius, in his system of the world,
proves clearly that he had no notion that Africa was
continued to the south of Ethiopia, that is of the tenth
degree of N. latitude. He thought, like Cleanthus and
Crates and other ancient authors, that the regions that lay
nearest the tropics, and were burnt by the sun, could not
be inhabited; and that the equatorial regions were occupied
by the ocean. He divided the hemisphere into five zones,
of which only two were habitable. "One of them," he
said, "is occupied by us, and the other by men of whose
nature we are ignorant."</p>

<p>Orosus, writing in the same century (fourth), and whose
work exercised so great an influence on the cosmographers of
the middle ages and on those who made the maps of the
world during that long period, was ignorant of the form or
boundaries of Africa, and of the contours of the peninsulas
of Southern Asia. He made the heavens rest upon the
earth.</p>

<p>S. Basil, also of the fourth century, placed the firmament
on the earth, and on this heaven a second, whose upper
surface was flat, notwithstanding that the inner surface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which is turned towards us is in the form of a vault; and
he explains in this way how the waters can be held there.
S. Cyril shows how useful this reservoir of water is to
the life of men and of plants.</p>

<p>Diodorus, Bishop of Tarsus, in the same century, also
divided the world into two stages, and compared it to a
tent. Severianus, Bishop of Gabala, about the same time,
compared the world to a house of which the earth is the
ground floor, the lower heavens the ceiling, and the upper,
or heaven of heavens, the roof. This double heaven was
also admitted by Eusebius of C&aelig;sar&aelig;a.</p>

<p>In the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries science made no
progress whatever. It was still taught that there were
limits to the ocean. Thus Lactantius asserted that there
could not be inhabitants beyond the line of the tropics.
This Father of the Church considered it a monstrous opinion
that the earth is round, that the heavens turn about it, and
that all parts of the earth are inhabited. "There are some
people," he says, "so extravagant as to persuade themselves
that there are men who have their heads downwards and
their feet upwards; that all that lies down here is hung
up there; that the trees and herbs grow downwards; and
that the snow and hail fall upwards.... Those people who
maintain such opinions do so for no other purpose than
to amuse themselves by disputation, and to show their
spirit; otherwise it would be easy to prove by invincible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
argument that it is impossible for the heavens to be underneath
the earth." (Divine Institution). Saint Augustin also,
in his <i>City of God</i>, says: "There is no reason to believe
in that fabulous hypothesis of the antipodes, that is to
say, of men who inhabit the other side of the earth&mdash;where
the sun rises when it sets with us, and who have their
feet opposed to ours." ... "But even if it were demonstrated
by any argument that the earth and world have a
spherical form, it would be too absurd to pretend that any
hardy voyagers, after having traversed the immensity of
the ocean, had been able to reach that part of the world
and there implant a detached branch of the prim&aelig;val
human family."</p>

<p>In the same strain wrote S. Basil, S. Ambrose, S. Justin
Martyr, S. Chrysostom, Procopius of Gaza, Severianus,
Diodorus Bishop of Tarsus, and the greater number of the
thinkers of that epoch.</p>

<p>Eusebius of C&aelig;sar&aelig;a was bold enough on one occasion
to write in his Commentaries on the Psalms, that,
"according to the opinion of some the earth is round;"
but he draws back in another work from so rash an assertion.
Even in the fifteenth century the monks of Salamanca
and Alcala opposed the old arguments against the antipodes
to all the theories of Columbus.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixteenth century Gregory of Tours
adopted also the opinion that the intertropical zone was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>uninhabitable, and, like other historians, he taught that the
Nile came from the unknown land in the east, descended
to the south, crossed the ocean which separated the antichthone
from Africa, and then alone became: visible. The
geographical and cosmographical ideas that were then preva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>lent
may also be judged of by what S. Avitus, a Latin poet
of the sixth century and nephew of the Emperor Flavius
Avitus, says in his poem on the Creation, where he describes
the terrestrial Paradise. "Beyond India," he writes, "<i>where
the world commences</i>, where the confines of heaven and earth
are joined, is an exalted asylum, inaccessible to mortals,
and closed by eternal barriers, since the first sin was
committed."</p>

<p>In a treatise on astronomy, published a little after this
in 1581, by Apian and Gemma Frison, they very distinctly
state their belief in a round earth, though they do not go into
details of its surface. The argument is the old one from
eclipses, but the figures they give in illustration are very
amusing, with three or four men of the size of the moon
disporting themselves on the earth's surface. As, however,
they all have their feet to the globe representing the earth,
and consequently have their feet in opposite directions at
the antipodes, the idea is very clearly shown.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 36.</span>
</div>

<p>"If," they say, "the earth were square, its shadow on the
moon would be square also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the earth were triangular, its shadow, during an
eclipse of the moon, would also be triangular.</p>

same figure.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 38.</span>
</div>

<p>"Since, then, the shadow of the earth is round, it is a
proof that the earth is round also."</p>

<p>This of course is one of the proofs that would be
employed in the present day for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of all the fantastical systems,
however, the <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i> of the cosmography of that age,
was the famous system of the square earth, with solid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
walls for supporting the heavens. Its author was <i>Cosmas</i>,
surnamed <i>Indicopleustes</i> after his voyage to India and
Ethiopia. He was at first a merchant, and afterwards a
monk. He died in 550. His manuscript was entitled
"Christian Topography," and was written in 535. It
was with the object of refuting the opinions of those
who gave a spherical form to the earth that Cosmas
composed his work after the systems of the Church
Fathers, and in opposition to the cosmography of the
Gentiles. He reduced to a systematic form the opinions of
the Fathers, and undertook to explain all the phenomena
of the heavens in accordance with the Scriptures. In
his first book he refutes the opinion of the sphericity
of the earth, which he regarded as a heresy. In the
second he expounds his own system, and the fifth to
the ninth he devotes to the courses of the stars.
This mongrel composition is a singular mixture of the
doctrines of the Indians, Chaldeans, Greeks, and Christian
Fathers.</p>

<p>With respect to his opponents he says, "There are on
all sides vigorous attacks against the Church," and accuses
them of misunderstanding Scripture, being misled by the
eclipses of the sun and moon. He makes great fun of
the idea of rain falling upwards, and yet accuses his opponents
of making the earth at the same time the centre
and the base of the universe. The zeal with which these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
pretended refutations are used proves, no doubt, that in
the sixth century there were some men, more sensible and
better instructed than others, who preserved the deposit of
progress accomplished by the Grecian genius in the
Alexandrian school, and defended the labours of Hipparchus
and Ptolemy; while it is manifest that the greater
number of their contemporaries kept the old Indian and
Homeric traditions, which were easier to understand, and
more accessible to the false witness of the senses, and not
improved by combination with texts of Scripture misinterpreted.
In fact, cosmographical science in the general
opinion retrograded instead of advancing.</p>

<p>According to Cosmas and his map of the world, the
habitable earth is a plane surface. But instead of being
supposed, as in the time of Thales, to be a disc, he represented
it in the form of a parallelogram, whose long sides
are twice the shorter ones, so that man is on the earth
like a bird in a cage. This parallelogram is surrounded
by the ocean, which breaks in in four great gulfs, namely,
the Mediterranean and Caspian seas, and the Persian and
Arabian gulfs.</p>

<p>Beyond the ocean in every direction there exists another
continent which cannot be reached by man, but of which
one part was once inhabited by him before the Deluge. To
the east, just as in other maps of the world, and in later
systems, he placed the <i>Terrestrial Paradise</i>, and the four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
rivers that watered Eden, which come by subterranean
channels to water the post-diluvian earth.</p>

<p>After the Fall, Adam was driven from Paradise; but he
and his descendants remained on its coasts until the Deluge
carried the ark of Noah to our present earth.</p>

<p>On the four outsides of the earth rise four perpendicular
walls, which surround it, and join together at the top in
a vault, the heavens forming the cupola of this singular
edifice.</p>

<p>The world, according to Cosmas, was therefore a large
oblong box, and it was divided into two parts; the first,
the abode of men, reaches from the earth to the firmament,
above which the stars accomplish their revolutions; there
dwell the angels, who cannot go any higher. The second
reaches upwards from the firmament to the upper vault,
which crowns and terminates the world. On this firmament
rest the waters of the heavens.</p>

<p>Cosmas justifies this system by declaring that, according
to the doctrine of the Fathers and the Commentators on the
Bible, the earth has the form of the Tabernacle that Moses
erected in the desert; which was like an oblong box, twice
as long as broad. But we may find other similarities,&mdash;for
this land beyond the ocean recalls the Atlantic of the
ancients, and the Mahomedans, and Orientals in general, say
that the earth is surrounded by a high mountain, which
is a similar idea to the walls of Cosmas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"God," he says, "in creating the earth, rested it on
nothing. The earth is therefore sustained by the power of
God, the Creator of all things, supporting all things by the
word of His power. If below the earth, or outside of it,
anything existed, it would fall of its own accord. So God
made the earth the base of the universe, and ordained that
it should sustain itself by its own proper gravity."</p>

<p>After having made a great square box of the universe, it
remained for him to explain the celestial phenomena, such
as the succession of days and nights and the vicissitudes
of the seasons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;The Square Earth.</span>
</div>

<p>This is the remarkable explanation he gives. He says
that the earth, that is, the oblong table circumscribed on all
sides by high walls, is divided into three parts; first the
habitable earth, which occupies the middle; secondly, the
ocean which surrounds this on all sides; and thirdly, another
dry land which surrounds the ocean, terminated itself by
these high walls on which the firmament rests. According
to him the habitable earth is always higher as we go north,
so that southern countries are always much lower than
northern. For this reason, he says, the Tigris and Euphrates,
which run towards the south, are much more rapid than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the Nile, which runs northwards. At the extreme north
there is a large conical mountain, behind which the sun,
moon, planets, and comets all set. These stars never pass
below the earth, they only pass behind this great mountain,
which hides them for a longer or shorter time from our
observation. According as the sun departs from or approaches
the north, and consequently is lower or higher in
the heavens, he disappears at a point nearer to or further
from the base of the mountain, and so is behind it a longer
or shorter time, whence the inequality of the days and
nights, the vicissitudes of the seasons, eclipses, and other
phenomena. This idea is not peculiar to Cosmas, for
according to the Indians, the mountain of Someirat is in
the centre of the earth, and when the sun appears to set, he
is really only hiding behind this mountain.</p>

<p>His idea, too, of the manner in which the motions are
performed is strange, but may be matched elsewhere. "All
the stars are created," he says, "to regulate the days and
nights, the months and the years, and they move, not at all
by the motion of the heaven itself, but by the action of
certain divine Beings, or <i>lampadophores</i>. God made the
angels for His service, and He has charged some of them with
the motion of the air, others with that of the sun, or the
moon, or the other stars, and others again with the collecting
of clouds and preparing the rain."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 41.&mdash;Explanation of Sunrise.</span>
</div>

<p>Similar to this were the ideas of other doctors of the
Church, such as S. Hilary and Theodorus, some of whom
supposed that the angels carried the stars on their shoulders
like the <i>omophores</i> of the Manichees; others that they rolled
them in front of them or drew them behind; while the
Jesuit Riccioli, who made astronomical observations, remarks
that each angel that pushes a star takes great care
to observe what the others are doing, so that the relative
distances between the stars may always remain what
they ought to be. The Abbot Trithemus gives the exact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
succession of the seven angels or spirits of the planets, who
take it in turns during a cycle of three hundred and fifty-four
years to govern the celestial motions from the creation
to the year 1522. The system thus introduced seems to
have been spread abroad, and to have lingered even into the
nineteenth century among the Arabs. A guide of that
nationality hired at Cairo in 1830, remarked to two travellers
how the earth had been made square and covered with
stones, but the stones had been thrown into the four corners,
now called France, Italy, England, and Russia, while the
centre, forming a circle round Mount Sinai, had been given
to the Arabians.</p>

<p>Alongside of this system of the square was another equally
curious&mdash;that of the egg. Its author was the famous Venerable
Bede, one of the most enlightened men of his time, who
was educated at the University of Armagh, which produced
Alfred and Alcuin. He says: "The earth is an element
placed in the middle of the world, as the yolk is in the
middle of an egg; around it is the water, like the white
surrounding the yolk; outside that is the air, like the membrane
of the egg; and round all is the fire which closes it in
as the shell does. The earth being thus in the centre receives
every weight upon itself, and though by its nature it is cold
and dry in its different parts, it acquires accidentally
different qualities; for the portion which is exposed to the
torrid action of the air is burnt by the sun, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
uninhabitable; its two extremities are too cold to be inhabited,
but the portion that lies in the temperate region
of the atmosphere is habitable. The ocean, which surrounds
it by its waves as far as the horizon, divides it into two parts,
the upper of which is inhabited by us, while the lower is
inhabited by our antipodes; although not one of them can
come to us, nor one of us to them."</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;The Earth as an Egg.</span>
</div>

<p>This last sentence shows that however far he may have
been from the truth, he did not, like so many of his contemporaries,
stumble over the idea of up and down in the
universe, and so consider the notion of antipodes absurd.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;The Earth as a Floating Egg.</span>
</div>

<p>A great number of the maps of the world of the period
followed this idea, and drew the world in the shape of an egg
at rest. It was broached, however, in another form by
Edrisi, an Arabian geographer of the eleventh century, who,
with many others, considered the earth to be like an egg
with one half plunged into the water. The regularity of the
surface is only interrupted by valleys and mountains. He
adopted the system of the ancients, who supposed that the
torrid zone was uninhabited. According to him the known
world only forms a single half of the egg, the greater part of
the water belonging to the surrounding ocean, in the midst of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
which earth floats like an egg in a basin. Several artists
and map-makers adopted this theory in the geographical
representations, and so, whether in this way or the last, the
egg has had the privilege of representing the form of the
earth for nearly a thousand years.</p>

<p>The celebrated Raban Maur, of Mayence, composed in the
ninth century a treatise, entitled <i>De Universo</i>, divided into
twenty-two books. It is a kind of encyclop&aelig;dia, in which he
gives an abridged view of all the sciences. According to his
cosmographic system the earth is in the form of a wheel,
and is placed in the middle of the universe, being surrounded
by the ocean; on the north it is bounded by the
Caucasus, which he supposes to be mountains of gold, which
no one can reach because of dragons, and griffins, and men
of monstrous shape that dwell there. He also places
Jerusalem in the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>The treatise of Honorus, entitled <i>Imago Mundi</i>, and many
other authors of the same kind, represent, 1st, the terrestrial
paradise in the most easterly portion of the world, in a
locality inaccessible to man; 2nd, the four rivers which had
their sources in Paradise; 3rd, the torrid zone, uninhabited;
4th, fantastic islands, transformed from the Atlantis into
<i>Antillia</i>.</p>

<p>In a manuscript commentary on the Apocalypse, which is
in the library of Turin, is a very curious chart, referred to
the tenth, but belonging possibly to the eighth century. It
represents the earth as a circular planisphere. The four
sides of the earth are each accompanied by a figure of a
wind, as a horse on a bellows, from which air is poured out,
as well as from a shell in his mouth. Above, or to the east,
are Adam, and Eve with the serpent. To their right is
Asia with two very elevated mountains&mdash;Cappadocia and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Caucasus. From thence comes the river <i>Eusis</i>, and the sea
into which it falls forms an arm of the ocean which surrounds
the earth. This arm joins the Mediterranean, and
separates Europe from Asia. Towards the middle is
Jerusalem, with two curious arms of the sea running past
it; while to the south there is a long and straight sea in
an east and west direction. The various islands of the
Mediterranean are put in a square patch, and Rome, France,
and Germany are indicated, while Thula, Britannia, and
Scotia are marked as islands in the north-west of the ocean
that surrounds the whole world.</p>

<p>We figure below two very curious maps of the world of
the tenth century&mdash;one of which is round, the other square.
The first is divided into three triangles; that of the east, or
Asia, is marked with the name of <i>Shem</i>; that of the north,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
or Europe, with that of <i>Japhet</i>; that of the south, or
Africa, with that of <i>Cham</i>. The second is also divided
between the three sons of Noah; the ocean surrounds it,
the Mediterranean forms the upright portion of a cross of
water which divides the Adamic world.</p>

<p>Omons, the author of a geographical poem entitled <i>The
Image of the World</i>, composed in 1265, who was called the
Lucretius of the thirteenth century, was not more advanced
than the cosmographers of the former centuries of which
we have hitherto spoken. The cosmographical part of his
poem is borrowed from the system of Pythagoras and the
Venerable Bede. He maintains that the earth is enveloped
in the heavens, as the yoke in the white of an egg, and that
it is in the middle as the centre is within the circle, and he
speaks like Pythagoras of the harmony of the celestial
spheres.</p>

<p>Omons supposed also that in his time the terrestrial
paradise was still existing in the east, with its tree of life,
its four rivers, and its angel with a flaming sword. He
appears to have confounded Hecla with the purgatory of St.
Patrick, and he places the latter in Iceland, saying that it
never ceases to burn. The volcanoes were only, according to
him, the breathing places or mouths of the infernal regions.
The latter he placed with other cosmographers in the
centre of the earth.</p>

<p>Another author, Nicephorus Blemmyde, a monk who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
lived during the same century, composed three cosmographical
works, among them the following: <i>On the Heavens
and the Earth, On the Sun and Moon, the Stars, and
Times and Days</i>. According to his system the earth is
flat, and he adopts the Homeric theory of the ocean
surrounding the world, and that of the seven climates.</p>

<p>Nicolas of Oresmus, a celebrated cosmographer of the
fourteenth century, although his celebrity as a mathematician
attracted the attention of King John of France, who made
him tutor to his son Charles V., was not wiser than those we
have enumerated above. He composed among other works
a <i>Treatise on the Sphere</i>. He rejected the theory of an
antichthonal continent as contrary to the faith. A map of
the world, prepared by him about the year 1377, represents
the earth as round, with one hemisphere only inhabited,
the other, or lower one, being plunged in the water. He
seems to have been led by various borrowed ideas, as, for
instance, theological ones, such as the statement in the
Psalms that God had founded the earth upon the waters,
and Grecian ones borrowed from the school of Thales, and
the theories of the Arabian geographers. In fact we have
seen that Edrisi thought that half of the earth was in the
water, and Aboulfeda thought the same. The earth was
placed by Nicolas in the centre of the universe, which he
represented by painting the sky blue, and dotting it over
with stars in gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Leonardo Dati, who composed a geographical poem entitled
<i>Della Spera</i>, during this century, advanced no further. A
coloured planisphere showed the earth in the centre of
the universe surrounded by the ocean, then the air, then
the circles of the planets after the Ptolemaic system,
and in another representation of the same kind he
figures the infernal regions in the centre of the earth,
and gives its diameter as seven thousand miles. He
proves himself not to have known one half of the globe
by his statement of the shape of the earth&mdash;that it is
like a T inside an O. This is a comparison given in
many maps of the world in the middle ages, the mean
parallel being about the 36th degree of north latitude,
that is to say at the Straits of Gibraltar; the Mediterranean
is thus placed so as to divide the earth into two
equal parts.</p>

<p>John Beauvau, Bishop of Angiers under Louis XL,
expresses his ideas as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The earth is situated and rests in the middle of the
firmament, as the centre or point is in the middle of a
circle. Of the whole earth mentioned above only one
quarter is inhabited. The earth is divided into four parts,
as an apple is divided through the centre by cutting it
lengthways and across. If one part of such an apple is
taken and peeled, and the peel is spread out over anything
flat, such as the palm of the hand, then it resembles the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
habitable earth, one side of which is called the east, and
the other the west."</p>

<p>The Arabians adopted not only the ideas of the ancients,
but also the fundamental notions of the cosmographical
system of the Greeks. Some of them, as <i>Bakouy</i>, regarded
the earth as a flat surface, like a table, others as a ball, of
which one half is cut off, others as a complete revolving
ball, and others that it was hollow within. Others again
went as far as to say that there were several suns and
moons for the several parts of the earth.</p>

<p>In a map, preserved in the library at Cambridge, by Henry,
Canon of St. Marie of Mayence, the form of the world
is given after Herodotus. The four cardinal points are
indicated, and the orientation is that of nearly all the cartographic
monuments of the middle ages, namely, the east at
the top of the map. The four cardinal points are four angels,
one foot placed on the disc of the earth; the colours of
their vestments are symbolical. The angel placed at the
Boreal extremity of the earth, or to the north of the
Scythians, points with his finger to people enclosed in the
ramparts of Gog and Magog, <i>gens immunda</i> as the legend
says. In his left hand he holds a die to indicate, no doubt,
that there are shut up the Jews who cast lots for the clothes
of Christ. His vestments are green, his mantle and his wings
are red. The angel placed to the left of Paradise has a
green mantle and wings, and red vestments. In his left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
hand he holds a kind of palm, and by the right he seems
to mark the way to Paradise. The position of the other
angels placed at the west of the world is different. They
seem occupied in stopping the passage beyond the <i>Columns</i>
(that is, the entrance to the Atlantic Ocean). All of them
have golden aureolas. The surrounding ocean is painted of
a clear green.</p>

<p>Another remarkable map of the world is that of Andrea
Bianco. In it we see Eden at the top, which represents the
east, and the four rivers are running out of it. Much of
Europe is indicated, including Spain, Paris, Sweden, Norway,
Ireland, which are named, England, Iceland, Spitzbergen, &amp;c.,
which are not named. The portion round the North Pole
to the left is indicated as "cold beneath the Pole star." In
these maps the systematic theories of the ancient geographers
seem mixed with the doctrines of the Fathers of the Church.
They place generally in the Red Sea some mark denoting the
passage of the Hebrews, the terrestrial paradise at the
extreme east, and Jerusalem in the centre. The towns are
figured often by edifices, as in the list of Theodosius, but
without any regard to their respective positions. Each town
is ordinarily represented by two towers, but the principal
ones are distinguished by a little wall that appears between
these two towers, on which are painted several windows, or
else they may be known by the size of the edifices. St.
James of Compostella in Gallicia and Rome are represented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
by edifices of considerable size, as are Nazareth, Troy,
Antioch, Damascus, Babylon, and Nineveh.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable monuments of the geography
of the last centuries of the middle ages is the map in
Hereford Cathedral, by Richard of Haldingham, not only on
account of its numerous legends, but because of its large
dimensions, being several square yards in area.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>On the upper part of this map is represented the Last
Judgment; Jesus Christ, with raised arms, holding in His
hands a scroll with these words, <i>Ecce testimonium meum</i>.
At His side two angels carry in their hands the instruments
of His passion. On the right hand stands an angel with a
trumpet to his mouth, out of which come these words,
<i>Levez si vendres vous par</i>. An angel brings forward a bishop
by the hand, behind whom is a king, followed by other
personages; the angel introduces them by a door formed of
two columns, which seems to serve as an entrance to an
edifice.</p>

<p>The Virgin is kneeling at the feet, of her Son. Behind her
is another woman kneeling, who holds a crown, which she
seems ready to place on the head of the Mother of Christ,
and by the side of the woman is a kneeling angel, who
appears to be supporting the maternal intercessor. The
Virgin uncovers her breast and pronounces the words of a
scroll which is held by an angel kneeling in front of her,
<i>Vei i b' fiz mon piz de deuiz lauele chare preistes&mdash;Eles mame
lettes dont leit de Virgin qui estes&mdash;Syes merci de tous si com
nos mesmes deistes.&mdash;R ... em ... ont servi kaut sauveresse me
feistes</i>.</p>

<p>To the left another angel, also with a trumpet to his mouth,
gives out the following words, which are written on a scroll,
<i>Leves si alles all fu de enfer estable</i>. A gate, drawn like that of
the entrance, represents probably the passage by which those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
must go out who are condemned to eternal pains. In fact the
devil is seen dragging after him a crowd of men, who are tied
by a cord which he holds in his hand.</p>

<p>The map itself commences at its upper part, that is, the
east, by the terrestrial paradise. It is a circle, in the centre
of which is represented the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil. Adam and Eve are there in company with the
serpent that beguiled them. The four legendary rivers come
out of the base of the tree, and they are seen below crossing
the map. Outside Eden the flight of the first couple, and the
angel that drove them away, are represented. At this extreme
eastern portion is the region of giants with the heads of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
beasts. There, too, is seen the first human habitation, or
town, built by Enoch. Below appears the Tower of Babel.
Near this are two men seated on a hill close to the river
Jaxartes; one of them is eating a human leg and the other
an arm, which the legend explains thus:&mdash;"Here live the
Essedons, whose custom it is to sing at the funerals of their
parents; they tear the corpses with their teeth, and prepare
their food with these fragments of flesh, mixed with that of
animals. In their opinion it is more honourable to the dead
to be enclosed in the bodies of their relations than in those
of worms."</p>

<p>Below are seen dragons and pigmies, always to the east of
Asia, and a little further away in the midst of a strange
country, <i>the King of the Cyclops</i>.</p>

<p>This extraordinary geography shows us in India the "Mantichore,
who has a triple range of teeth, the face of a man,
blue eyes, the red colour of blood, the body of a lion, and
the tail of a scorpion; its voice is a whistle."</p>

<p>On the north of the Ganges is represented a man with one
leg, shading his head with his foot, which is explained by the
following legend:&mdash;"In India dwell the Monocles, who have
only one leg, but who nevertheless move with surprising
velocity; when they wish to protect themselves from the heat
of the sun they make a shadow with the sole of their foot,
which is very large."</p>

<p>The Blemmys have their mouth and eyes in their chest;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
others have their mouths and eyes on their shoulders. The
Parvini are Ethiopians that have four eyes.</p>

<p>To the east of Syene is a man seated who is covering his
head with his lip, "people who with their prominent lip
shade their faces from the sun."</p>

<p>Above is drawn a little sun, with the word <i>sol</i>. Then
comes an animal of human form, having the feet of a horse
and the head and beak of a bird; he rests on a stick, and
the legend tells us it is a satyr; the fauns, half men and
half horses; the cynocephales&mdash;men with the head of a dog;
and the cyanthropes&mdash;dogs with the heads of men. The
sphinx has the wings of a bird, the tail of a serpent, the
head of a woman. It is placed in the midst of the Cordilleras,
which are joined to a great chain of mountains.
Here lastly is seen the <i>monoceros</i>, a terrible animal; but here
is the marvel: "When one shows to this <i>monoceros</i> a young
girl, who, when the animal approaches, uncovers her breast,
the monster, forgetting his ferocity, lays his head there, and
when he is asleep may be taken defenceless."</p>

<p>Near to the lake Meotides is a man clothed in Oriental
style, with a hat that terminates in a point, and holding by
the bridle a horse whose harness is a human skin, and which
is explained thus by the Latin legend: "Here live the
griffins, very wicked men, for among other crimes they
proceed so far as to make clothes for themselves and their
horses out of the skins of their enemies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>More to the south is a large bird, the ostrich; according to
the legend, "the ostrich has the head of a goose, the body
of a crane, the feet of a calf; it eats iron."</p>

<p>Not far from the Riphean Mountains two men with long
tunics and round bonnets are represented in the attitude of
fighting; one brandishes a sword, the other a kind of club,
and the legend tells us, "The customs of the people of the
interior of Scythia are somewhat wild; they inhabit caves;
they drink the blood of the slain by sucking their wounds;
they pride themselves on the number of people they have
slain&mdash;not to have slain any one in combat is reckoned
disgraceful."</p>

<p>Near the river that empties itself into the Caspian Sea it
is written: "This river comes from the infernal regions; it
enters the sea after having descended from mountains covered
with wood, and it is there, they say, that the mouth of hell
opens."</p>

<p>To the south of this river, and to the north of Hyrcania, is
represented a monster having the body of a man, the head,
tail, and feet of a bull: this is the Minotaur. Further on
are the mountains of Armenia, and the ark of Noah on
one of its plateaux. Here, too, is seen a large tiger, and we
read: "The tiger, when he sees that he has been deprived of
his young, pursues the ravisher precipitately; but the latter,
hastening away on his swift horse, throws a mirror to him
and is safe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsewhere appears Lot's wife changed into a pillar of salt;
the lynx who can see through a stone wall; the river Lethe; so
called because all who drink of it forget everything.</p>

<p>Numerous other details might be mentioned, but enough
has been said to show the curious nature and exceeding
interest of this map, in which matters of observation and
imagination are strangely mixed. Another very curious
geographical document of that epoch is the map of the world
of the <i>Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denis</i>. This belongs to
the fourteenth century. The capitals here too are represented
by edifices. The Mediterranean is a vertical canal, which
goes from the Columns of Hercules to Jerusalem. The
Caspian Sea communicates with it to the north, and the Red
Sea to the south-east, by the Nile. It preserves the same position
for Paradise and for the land of Gog and Magog that we
have seen before. The geography of Europe is very defective.
Britannia and Anglia figure as two separate islands, being
represented off the west coast of Spain, with Allemania and
Germania, also two distinct countries, to the north. The ocean
is represented as round the whole, and the various points of
the compass are represented by different kinds of winds on
the outside.</p>

</div>

<p>This was the general style of the maps of the world at that
period, as we may perceive from the various illustrations we
have been able to give, and it curiously initiates us into the
medi&aelig;val ideas. Sometimes they are surrounded by laughable
figures of the winds with inflated cheeks, sometimes there
are drawn light children of Eolus seated on leathern bottles,
rotating the liquid within; at other times, saints, angels,
Adam and Eve, or other people, adorn the circumference of
the map. Within are shown a profusion of animals, trees,
populations, monuments, tents, draperies, and monarchs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
seated on their thrones&mdash;an idea which was useful, no
doubt, and which gave the reader some knowledge of the
local riches, the ethnography, the local forms of government
and of architecture in the various countries represented; but
the drawings were for the most part childish, and more
fantastic than real. The language, too, in which they were
written was as mixed as the drawings; no regularity was
preserved in the orthography of a name, which on the same
map may be written in ten different ways, being expressed in
barbarous Latin, Roman, or Old French, Catalan, Italian,
Castilian, or Portuguese!</p>

<p>During the same epoch other forms of maps in less detail
and of smaller size show the characters that we have seen in
the maps of earlier centuries.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, the traveller, at the end of the fourteenth
century, has preserved in his writings all the ancient traditions,
and united them in a singular manner with the results
of his own observations. He had not seen Paradise, but he
had seen the ark of Noah resting on the top of Ararat. His
map of the world, preserved in the library at Stockholm, is
oval, and represents two continents.</p>

<p>In that which we inhabit, the only seas indicated are the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Asia appears at the east,
Europe to the north, and Africa to the south. The other
continent to the south of the equator, which is not marked,
is Antichthonia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>In a map of the world engraved on a medal of the fifteenth
century during the reign of Charles V. there is still a reminiscence
of the ideas of the concealed earth and Meropides,
as described by Theopompus. We see the winds as cherubim;
Europe more accurately represented than usual; but Africa
still unknown, and a second continent, called Brum&aelig;, instead
of Antichthonia, with imaginary details upon it.</p>

<p>If such were the ideas entertained amongst the most
enlightened nations, what may we expect among those who
were less advanced? It would take us too long to describe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
all that more Eastern nations have done upon this point since
the commencement of our present era, but we may give an
example or two from the Arabians.</p>

</div>

<p>In the ancient Arabian chronicle of Tabari is a system
founded on the earth being the solid foundation of all things;
we read: "The prophet says, the all-powerful and inimitable
Deity has created the mountain of Kaf round about the
earth; it has been called the foundation pile of the earth, as it
is said in the Koran, 'The mountains are the piles.' This
world is in the midst of the mountain of Kaf, just as the
finger is in the midst of the ring. This mountain is emerald,
and blue in colour; no man can go to it, because he would
have to pass four months in darkness to do so. There is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
that mountain neither sun, nor moon, nor stars; it is so blue
that the azure colour you see in the heavens comes from the
brilliancy of the mountain of Kaf, which is reflected in the
sky. If this were not so the sky would not be blue. All the
mountains that you see are supported by Kaf; if it did not
exist, all the earth would be in a continual tremble, and not
a creature could live upon its surface. The heavens rest upon
it like a tent."</p>

<p>Another Arabian author, Benakaty, writing in 1317, says:
"Know that the earth has the form of a globe suspended in
the centre of the heavens. It is divided by the two great
circles of the meridian and equator, which cut each other at
light angles, into four equal parts, namely, those of the north-west,
north-east, south-west, and south-east. The inhabited
portion of the earth is situated in the southern hemisphere,
of which one half is inhabited."</p>

<p>Ibn-Wardy, who lived in the same century, adopted the
idea of the ocean surrounding all the earth, and said we knew
neither its depth nor its extent.</p>

<p>This ocean was also acknowledged by the author of the
Kaf mountain; he says it lies between the earth and that
mountain, and calls it Bahr-al-Mohith.</p>

<p>The end of the fifteenth century saw the dawn of a new
era in knowledge and science. The discoveries of Columbus
changed entirely the aspect of matters, the imagination was
excited to fresh enterprises, and the hardihood of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
adventurers through good or bad success was such as want
of liberty could not destroy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we have seen, Columbus imagined the
earth to have the shape of a pear. Not that he obtained
this idea from his own observations, but rather retained it
as a relic of past traditions. It is probable that it really
dates from the seventh century. We may read in several
cosmographical manuscripts of that epoch, that the earth has
the form of a cone or a top, its surface rising from south to
north. These ideas were considerably spread by the compilations
of John of Beauvais in 1479, from whom probably
Columbus derived his notion.</p>

<p>Although Columbus is generally and rightly known as the
discoverer of the New World, a very curious suit was brought
by Pinzon against his heirs in 1514. Pinzon pretended
that the discovery was due to him alone, as Columbus had
only followed his advice in making it. Pinzon told the
admiral himself that the required route was intimated by
an inspiration, or revelation. The truth was that this
"revelation" was due to a flock of parrots, flying in the
evening towards the south-west, which Pinzon concluded
must be going in the direction of an invisible coast to pass
the night in the bushes. Certainly the consequences of
Columbus resisting the advice of Pinzon would have been most
remarkable; for had he continued to sail due west he would
have been caught by the Gulf Stream and carried to Florida,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
or possibly to Virginia, and in this case the United States
would have received a Spanish and Catholic population,
instead of an English and Protestant one.</p>

<p>The discoveries of those days were often commemorated
by the formation of heraldic devices for the authors of them,
and we have in this way some curious coats of arms on record.
That, for instance, of Sebastian Cano was a globe, with the
legend, <i>Primus circumdedisti me</i>. The arms given to Columbus
in 1493 consisted of the first map of America, with a
range of islands in a gulf. Charles V. gave to Diego
of Ordaz the figure of the Peak of Orizaba as his arms, to
commemorate his having ascended it; and to the historian
Oviedo, who passed thirty-four years without interruption
(1513-47) in tropical America, the four beautiful stars of
the Southern Cross.</p>

<p>We have arrived at the close of our history of the attempts
that preceded the actual discovery of the form and constitution
of the globe; since these were established our further
progress has been in matters of detail. There now remains
briefly to notice the attempts at discovering the size of the
earth on the supposition, and afterwards certainty, of its
being a globe.</p>

<p>The earliest attempt at this was made by Eratosthenes,
246 years before our era, and it was founded on the following
reasoning. The sun illuminates the bottom of pits at Syene
at the summer solstice; on the same day, instead of being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
vertical over the heads of the inhabitants of Alexandria, it is
7&frac14; degrees from the zenith. Seven-and-a-quarter degrees
is the fiftieth part of an entire circumference; and the
distance between the two towns is five thousand stadia; hence
the circumference of the earth is fifty times this distance,
or 250 thousand stadia.</p>

<p>A century before our era Posidonius arrived at an analogous
result by remarking that the star Canopus touched the horizon
at Rhodes when it was 7 degrees 12 minutes above that of
Alexandria.</p>

<p>These measurements, which, though rough, were ingenious,
were, followed in the eighth century by similar
ones by the Arabian Caliph, Almamoun, who did not
greatly modify them.</p>

<p>The first men who actually went round the world were
the crew of the ship under Magellan, who started to the west in
1520; he was slain by the Philippine islanders in 1521, but his
ship, under his lieutenant, Sebastian Cano, returned by the
east in 1522. The first attempt at the actual measurement of
a part of the earth's surface along the meridian was made by
Fernel in 1528. His process was a singular, but simple one,
namely, by counting the number of the turns made by the
wheels of his carriage between Paris and Amiens. He made
the number 57,020, and accurate measurements of the distance
many years after showed he had not made an error of
more than four turns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>.</p>

<p>The astronomer Picard attempted it again under Louis
XIV. by triangulation.</p>

<p>The French astronomers have always been forward in this
inquiry, and to them we owe the systematic attempts to
arrive at a truer knowledge of the length of an arc of the
meridian which were made in 1735-45 in Lapland and in
Peru; and later under Mechain and Delambre, by order of the
National Assembly, for the basis of the metrical system.</p>

<p>Observations of this kind have also been made by the
English, as at Lough Foyle in Ireland, and in India.</p>

<p>The review which has here been made of the various
ideas on what now seems so simple a matter cannot but
impress us with the vast contrast there is between the wild
attempts of the earlier philosophers and our modern affirmations.
What progress has been made in the last two thousand
years! And all of this is due to hard work. The true
revelation of nature is that which we form ourselves, by our
persevering efforts. We now know that the earth is approximately
spherical, but flattened by about 1/300 at the poles, is
three-quarters covered with water, and enveloped everywhere
by a light atmospheric mantle. The distance from the centre
of the earth to its surface is 3,956 miles, its area is 197
million square miles, its volume is 256,000 millions of cubic
miles, its weight is six thousand trillion tons. So, thanks to
the bold measurements of its inhabitants, we know as much
about it as we are likely to know for a long time to come.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>LEGENDARY WORLDS OF THE MIDDLE AGES.</h3>


<p>The legends that were for so many ages prevalent in Europe
had their foundation in the attempt to make the accounts of
Scripture and the ideas and dogmas of the Fathers of the
Church fit into the few and insignificant facts that were
known with respect to the earth, and the system of which
it forms a part, and the far more numerous imaginations that
were entertained about it.</p>

<p>We are therefore led on to examine some of these legends,
that we may appreciate how far a knowledge of astronomy will
effect the eradication of errors and fantasies which, under the
aspect of truth, have so long enslaved the people. No doubt
the authors of the legendary stories knew well enough their
allegorical nature; but those who received them supposed
that they gave true indications of the nature of the earth
and world, and therefore accepted them as facts.</p>

<p>Some indeed considered that the whole physical constitution
of the world was a scaffold or a model, and that there was a real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
theological universe hidden beneath this semblance. No one
omitted from his system the spiritual heaven in which the
angels and just men might spend their existence; but in
addition to this there were places whose reality was believed
in, but whose locality is more difficult to settle, and which
therefore were moved from one place to another by various
writers, viz., the infernal regions, purgatory, and the terrestrial
paradise.</p>

<p>We will here recount some of those legends, which wielded
sufficient sway over men's minds as to gain their belief in the
veritable existence of the places described, and in this way
to influence their astronomical and cosmographical ideas.</p>

<p>And for the first we will descend to the infernal regions
with Plutarch and Thespesius.</p>

<p>This Thespesius relates his adventures in the other world.
Having fallen head-first from an elevated place, he found
himself unwounded, but was contused in such a way as to
be insensible. He was supposed to be dead, but, after three
days, as they were about to bury him, he came to life again.
In a few days he recovered his former powers of mind and
body; but made a marvellous change for the better in
his life.</p>

<p>He said that at the moment that he lost consciousness he
found himself like a sailor at the bottom of the sea; but
afterwards, having recovered himself a little, he was able to
breathe perfectly, and seeing only with the eyes of his soul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
he looked round on all that was about him. He saw no longer
the accustomed sights, but stars of prodigious magnitude,
separated from each other by immense distances. They were
of dazzling brightness and splendid colour. His soul, carried
like a vessel on the luminous ocean, sailed along freely and
smoothly, and moved everywhere with rapidity.  Passing
over in silence a large number of the sights that met his eye,
he stated that the souls of the dead, taking the form of
bubbles of fire, rise through the air, which opens a passage
above them; at last the bubbles, breaking without noise, let
out the souls in a human form and of a smaller size, and
moving in different ways.  Some, rising with astonishing
lightness, mounted in a straight line; others, running round
like a whipping-top, went up and down by turns with a confused
and irregular motion, making small advance by long
and painful efforts. Among this number he saw one of his
parents, whom he recognised with difficulty, as she had died
in his infancy; but she approached him, and said, "Good
day, Thespesius." Surprised to hear himself called by this
name, he told her that he was called Arideus, and not
Thespesius.  "That was once your name," she replied,
"but in future you will bear that of Thespesius, for you
are not dead, only the intelligent part of your soul has
come here by the particular will of the gods; your other
faculties are still united to your body, which keeps them
like an anchor. The proof I will give you is that the souls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of the dead do not cast any shadow, and they cannot move
their eyes."</p>

<p>Further on, in traversing a luminous region, he heard, as
he was passing, the shrill voice of a female speaking in verse,
who presided over the time Thespesius should die. His
genius told him that it was the voice of the Sibyl, who, turning
on the orbit of the moon, foretold the future. Thespesius
would willingly have heard more, but, driven off by a rapid
whirlwind, he could make out but little of her predictions.
In another place he remarked several parallel lakes, one filled
with melted and boiling gold, another with lead colder than
ice, and a third with very rough iron. They were kept by
genii, who, armed with tongs like those used in forges, plunged
into these lakes, and then withdrew by turns, the souls of
those whom avarice or an insatiable cupidity had led into
crime; after they had been plunged into the lake of gold,
where the fire made them red and transparent, they were
thrown into the lake of lead. Then, frozen by the cold, and
made as hard as hail, they were put into the lake of iron,
where they became horribly black. Broken and bruised on
account of their hardness, they changed their form, and passed
once more into the lake of gold, and suffered in these changes
inexpressible pain.</p>

<p>In another place he saw the souls of those who had to
return to life and be violently forced to take the form of all
sorts of animals. Among the number he saw the soul of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Nero, which had already suffered many torments, and was
bound with red-hot chains of iron. The workmen were seizing
him to give him the form of a viper, under which he was
destined to live, after having devoured the womb that bore him.</p>

<p>The locality of these infernal regions was never exactly
determined. The ancients were divided upon the point.
In the poems of Homer the infernal regions appear under
two different forms: thus, in the <i>Iliad</i>, it is a vast
subterranean cavity; while in the <i>Odyssey</i>, it is a distant
and mysterious country at the extremity of the earth, beyond
the ocean, in the neighbourhood of the Cimmerians.</p>

<p>The description which Homer gives of the infernal region
proves that in his time the Greeks imagined it to be a copy
of the terrestrial world, but one which had a special character.
According to the philosophers it was equally remote from all
parts of the earth. Thus Cicero, in order to show that
it was of no consequence where one died, said, wherever we
die there is just as long a journey to be made to reach the
"infernal regions."</p>

<p>The poets fixed upon certain localities as the entrance to
this dismal empire: such was the river Lethe, on the borders
of the Scythians; the cavern Acherusia in Epirus, the mouth
of Pluto, in Laodic&#339;a, the cave of Zenarus near Laced&aelig;mon.</p>

<p>In the map of the world in the <i>Polychronicon</i> of Ranulphus
Uygden, now in the British Museum, it is stated: "The
Island of Sicily was once a part of Italy. There is Mount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Etna, containing the infernal regions and purgatory, and it
has Scylla and Charybdis, two whirlpools."</p>

<p>Ulysses was said to reach the place of the dead by crossing
the ocean to the Cimmerian land, &AElig;neas to have entered it
by the Lake of Avernus. Xenophon says that Hercules went
there by the peninsula of Arechusiade.</p>

<p>Much of this, no doubt, depends on the exaggeration and
misinterpretation of the accounts of voyagers; as when the
Ph&#339;nicians related that, after passing the Columns of Hercules,
to seek tin in Thule and amber in the Baltic, they came,
at the extremity of the world, to the Fortunate Isles, the
abode of eternal spring, and further on to the Hyperborean
regions, where a perpetual night enveloped the country&mdash;the
imagination of the people developed from this the Elysian
fields, as the places of delight in the lower regions, having
their own sun, moon, and stars, and Tartarus, a place of
shades and desolation.</p>

<p>In every case, however, both among pagans and Christians,
the locality was somewhere in the centre of the earth. The
poets and philosophers of Greece and Rome made very
detailed and circumstantial maps of the subterranean regions.
They enumerated its rivers, its lakes, and woods, and mountains,
and the places where the Furies perpetually tormented
the wicked souls who were condemned to eternal punishment.
These ideas passed naturally into the creeds of Christians
through the sect of the Essenes, of whom Josephus writes as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
follows:&mdash;"They thought that the souls of the just go beyond
the ocean to a place of repose and delight, where they were
troubled by no inconvenience, no change of seasons. Those
of the wicked, on the contrary, were relegated to places
exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather, and suffered
eternal torments. The Essenes," adds the same author, "have
similar ideas about these torments to those of the Greeks
about Tartarus and the kingdom of Pluto. The greater part
of the Gnostic sects, on the contrary, considered the lower
regions as simply a place of purgatory, where the soul is
purified by fire."</p>

<p>Amongst all the writings of Christian ages in which matters
such as we are now passing in review are described, there is
one that stands out beyond all others as a masterpiece, and
that is the magnificent poem of Dante, his <i>Divine Comedy</i>,
wherein he described the infernal regions as they presented
themselves to his lively and fertile imagination. We have in
it a picture of medi&aelig;val ideas, painted for us in indelible
lines, before the remembrance of them was lost in the past.
The poem is at once a tomb and a cradle&mdash;the tomb of a
world that was passing, the cradle of the world that was to
come: a portico between two temples, that of the past and
that of the future. In it are deposited the traditions, the
ideas, the sciences of the past, as the Egyptians deposited
their kings and symbolic gods in the sepulchres of Thebes
and Memphis. The future brings into it its aspirations and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
its germs enveloped in the swaddling clothes of a rising
language and a splendid poetry&mdash;a mysterious infant that is
nourished by the two teats of sacred tradition and profane
fiction, Moses and St. Paul, Homer and Virgil.</p>

<p>The theology of Dante, strictly orthodox, was that of St.
Thomas and the other doctors of the Church. Natural philosophy,
properly so called, was not yet in existence. In
astronomy, Ptolemy reigned supreme, and in the explanation
of celestial phenomena no one dreamt or dared to dream of
departing in any way from the traditionally sacred system.</p>

<p>In those days astronomy was indissolubly linked with a
complete series of philosophical and theological ideas, and
included the physics of the world, the science of life in
every being, of their organisation, and the causes on which
depended the aptitudes, inclinations, and even in part the
actions, of men, the destinies of individuals, and the events
of history. In this theological, astronomical, and terrestrial
universe everything emanated from God; He had created
everything, and the creation embraced two orders of beings,
the immaterial and the corporeal.</p>

<p>The pure spirits composed the nine choirs of the celestial
hierarchy. Like so many circles, they were ranged round a
fixed point, the Eternal Being, in an order determined by their
relative perfection. First the seraphim, then the cherubim,
and afterwards the simple angels. Those of the first circle
received immediately from the central point the light and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the virtue which they communicated to those of the second;
and so on from circle to circle, like mirrors which reflect,
with an ever-lessening light, the brilliancy of a single
luminous point. The nine choirs, supported by Love, turned
without ceasing round their centre in larger and larger circles
according to their distance; and it was by their means that
the motion and the divine inflatus was communicated to the
material creation.</p>

<p>This latter had in the upper part of it the empyreal, or
heaven of pure light. Below that, was the <i>Primum mobile</i>,
the greatest body in the heavens, as Dante calls it, because it
surrounds all the rest of the circle, and bounds the material
world. Then came the heaven of the fixed stars; then, continuing
to descend, the heavens of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the
sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, and lastly, the earth, whose
solid and compact nucleus is surrounded by the spheres of
water, air, and fire.</p>

<p>As the choirs of angels turn about a fixed point, so the
nine material circles turn also about another fixed point, and
are moved by the pure spirits.</p>

<p>Let us now descend to the geography of the interior of the
earth. Within the earth is a large cone, whose layers are the
frightful abodes of the condemned, and which ends in the
centre, where the divine Justice keeps bound up to his chest
in ice the prince of the rebellious angels, the emperor of
the kingdom of woe. Such are the infernal regions which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Dante describes according to ideas generally admitted in
the middle ages.</p>

<p>The form of the infernal regions was that of a funnel or
reversed cone. All its circles were concentric, and continually
diminished; the principal ones were nine in number. Virgil
also admitted nine divisions&mdash;three times three, a number
sacred <i>par excellence</i>. The seventh, eighth, and ninth circles
were divided into several regions; and the space between the
entrance to the infernal regions and the river Acheron,
where the resting-place of the damned really commenced,
was divided into two parts. Dante, guided by Virgil,
traversed all these circles.</p>

<p>It was in 1300 that the poet, "in the midst of the course
of life," at the age of thirty-five, passed in spirit through the
three regions of the dead. Lost in a lonely, wild, and dismal
forest, he reached the base of a hill, which he attempted to
climb. But three animals, a panther, a lion, and a thin and
famished wolf, prevented his passage; so, returning again
where the sun was powerless, into the shades of the
depths of the valley, there met him a shadow of the
dead. This human form, whom a long silence had deprived
of speech, was Virgil, who was sent to guide and succour him
by a celestial dame, Beatrice, the object of his love, who was
at the same time a real and a mystically ideal being.</p>

<p>Virgil and Dante arrived at the gate of the infernal
regions; they read the terrible inscription placed over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
gate; they entered and found first those unhappy souls who
had lived without virtue and without vice. They reached
the banks of Acheron and saw Charon, who carried over the
souls in his bark to the other side; and Dante was surprised
by a profound sleep. He woke beyond the river, and he
descended into the Limbo which is the first circle of the
infernal regions. He found there the souls of those who had
died without baptism, or who had been indifferent to religion.</p>

<p>They descended next to the second circle, where Minos, the
judge of those below, is enthroned. Here the luxurious are
punished. The poet here met with Francesca of Rimini and
Paul, her friend. He completely recovered the use of his
senses, and passed through the third circle, where the gourmands
are punished. In the fourth he found Plutus, who
guards it. Here are tormented the prodigal and the avaricious.
In the fifth are punished those who yield to anger. Dante
and Virgil there saw a bark approaching, conducted by
Phlegias; they entered it, crossed a river, and arrived thus
at the base of the red-hot iron walls of the infernal town of
Dite. The demons that guarded the gates refused them
admittance, but an angel opened them, and the two travellers
there saw the heretics that were enclosed in tombs surrounded
by flames.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Dante&#39;s Infernal Regions.</span>
</div>

<p>The travellers then visited the circles of violence, fraud,
and usury, when they came to a river of blood guarded
by a troop of centaurs; suddenly they saw coming to them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Geryon, who represents fraud, and this beast took them
behind him to carry them across the rest of the infernal
space.</p>

<p>The eighth circle was divided into ten valleys, comprising:
the flatterers; the simoniacal; the astrologers; the sorcerers;
the false judges; the hypocrites who walked about clothed
with heavy leaden garments; the thieves, eternally stung
by venomous serpents; the heresiarchs; the charlatans,
and the forgers.</p>

<p>At last the poets descended into the ninth circle, divided
into four regions, where are punished four kinds of traitors.
Here is recounted the admirable episode of Count Ugolin.
In the last region, called the region of Judas, <span class="smcap">Lucifer</span> is
enchained. There is the centre of the earth, and Dante,
hearing the noise of a little brook, reascended to the other
hemisphere, on the surface of which he found, surrounded
by the Southern Ocean, the mountain of Purgatory.</p>

<p>Such was the famous <i>Inferno</i> of Dante.</p>

<p>Not only was the geography of the infernal regions
attempted in the middle ages, but even their size. Dexelius
calculated that the number of the damned was a hundred
millions, and that their abode need not measure more than
one German mile in every direction. Cyrano of Bergerac
amusingly said that it was the damned that kept turning
the earth, by hanging on the ceiling like bats, and trying
to get away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1757 an English clergyman, Dr. Swinden, published
a book entitled, <i>Researches on the Nature of the Fire of
Hell and the Place where it is situated</i>. He places it in
the sun. According to him the Christians of the first
century had placed it beneath the earth on account of a
false interpretation of the descent of Jesus into hell after
his crucifixion, and by false ideas of cosmography. He
attempted to show, 1st, that the terrestrial globe is too
small to contain even the angels that fell from heaven after
their battle; 2nd, that the fire of hell is real, and that the
closed globe of earth could not support it a sufficiently long
period; 3rd, that the sun alone presents itself as the necessary
place, being a well-sustained fire, and directly opposite
in situation to heaven, since the empyreal is round the
outside of the universe, and the sun in the centre. What
a change to the present ideas, even of doctors of divinity,
in a hundred years!</p>

<p>So far, then, for medi&aelig;val ideas on the position and
character of hell. Next as to purgatory.</p>

<p>The voyage to purgatory that has met with most success
is certainly the celebrated Irish legend of St. Patrick,
which for several centuries was admitted as authentic, and
the account of which was composed certainly a century
before the poem of Dante.</p>

<p>This purgatory, the entrance to which is drawn in more
than one illuminated manuscript, is situated in Ireland, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
one of the islands of Lough Derg, County Donegal, where
there are still two chapels and a shrine, at which annual
ceremonies are performed. A knight, called Owen, resolved
to visit it for penance; and the chronicle gives us an
account of his adventures.</p>

<p>First he had his obsequial rites performed, as if he had
been dead, and then he advanced boldly into the deep
ravine; he marched on courageously, and entered into
the semi-shadows; he marched on, and even this funereal
twilight abandoned him, and "when he had gone for a long
time in this obscurity, there appeared to him a little light
as it were from a glimmer of day." He arrived at a house,
built with much care, an imposing mansion of grief and
hope, a marvellous edifice, but similar nevertheless to a
monkish cloister, where there was no more light than there
is in this world in winter at vesper-time.</p>

<p>The knight was in dreadful suspense. Suddenly he
heard a terrible noise, as if the universe was in a riot; for
it seemed certainly to him as if every kind of beast and
every man in the world were together, and each gave utterance
to their own cry, at one time and with one voice, so
that they could not make a more frightful noise.</p>

<p>Then commenced his trials, and discourse with the infernal
beings; the demons yelled with delight or with fury round
him. "Miserable wretch," said some, "you are come
here to suffer."  "Fly," said others, "for you have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
behaved well in the time that is passed: if you will take
our advice, and will go back again to the world, we will
take it as a great favour and courtesy."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/339.jpg" width="550" height="800" alt="Plate XII." title="" />
<span class="caption">Plate XII.&mdash;The Legend of Owen.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Owen was thrown on the dark shadowy earth, where the
demons creep like hideous serpents. A mysterious wind,
which he scarcely heard, passed over the mud, and it seemed
to the knight as if he had been pierced by a spear-head.
After a while the demons lifted him up; they took him
straight off to the east, where the sun rises, as if they were
going to the place where the universe ends. "Now, after
they had journeyed for a long time here and there over
divers countries, they brought him to an open field, very
long and very full of griefs and chastisements; he could
not see the end of the field, it was so long; there were men
and women of various ages, who lay down all naked on
the ground with their bellies downwards, who had hot nails
driven into their hands and feet; and there was a fiery
dragon, who sat upon them and drove his teeth into their
flesh, and seemed as if he would eat them; hence they
suffered great agony, and bit the earth in spite of its
hardness, and from time to time they cried most piteously
'Mercy, mercy;' but there was no one there who had pity
or mercy, for the devils ran among them and over them,
and beat them most cruelly."</p>

<p>The devils brought the knight towards a house of punishment,
so broad and long that one could not see the end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
This house is the house of baths, like those of the infernal
regions, and the souls that are bathed in ignominy are there
heaped in large vats. "Now so it was, that each of these
vats was filled with some kind of metal, hot and boiling,
and there they plunged and bathed many people of various
ages, some of whom were plunged in over their heads, others
up to the eyebrows, others up to the eyes, and others up
to the mouth. Now all in truth of these people cried out
with a loud voice and wept most piteously."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the knight passed this terrible place, and
left behind in his mysterious voyage that column of fire
which rose like a lighthouse in the shades, and which shone
so sadly betwixt hope and eternal despair, than a vast
and magnificent spectacle displayed itself in the subterranean
space.</p>

<p>This luminous and odorescent region, where one might
see so many archbishops, bishops, and monks of every order,
was the terrestrial paradise; man does not stay there
always; they told the knight that he could not taste too
long its rapid delights; it is a place of transition between
purgatory and the abodes of heaven, just as the dark places
which he had traversed were made by the Creator between
the world and the infernal regions.</p>

<p>"In spite of our joys," said the souls, "we shall pass
away from here." Then they took him to a mountain, and
told him to look, and asked of him what colour the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
heavens seemed to be there where he was standing, and he
replied it was the colour of burning gold, such as is in
the furnace; and then they said to him, "That which
you see is the entrance to heaven and the gate of
paradise."</p>

<p>The attempts at identification of hell and purgatory have
not been so numerous, perhaps because the subjects were
not very attractive, except as the spite of men might think
of them in reference to other people; but when we come to
the terrestrial paradise, quite a crowd of attempts by every
kind of writer to fix its position in any and every part of
the globe is met with on every side.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, under Louis XIV., Daniel
Huet, Bishop of Avranches, gave great attention to the
question, and collected every opinion that had been expressed
upon it, with a view to arriving at some definite
conclusion for himself. He was astonished at the number
of writings and the diversity of the opinions they
expressed.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he says, "could show me better how little is
really known about the situation of the terrestrial paradise
than the differences in the opinions of those who have
occupied themselves about the question. Some have placed
it in the third heaven, some in the fourth, in the heaven of
the moon, in the moon itself, on a mountain near the lunar
heaven, in the middle region of the air, out of the earth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
upon the earth, beneath the earth, in a place that is hidden
and separated from man.  It has been placed under the
North Pole, in Tartary, or in the place now occupied by the
Caspian Sea. Others placed it in the extreme south, in the
land of fire. Others in the Levant, or on the borders of the
Ganges, or in the Island of Ceylon, making the name India
to be derived from Eden, the land where the paradise was
situated. It has been placed in China, or in an inaccessible
place beyond the Black Sea; by others in America, in Africa,
beneath the equator, in the East, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this formidable array, the good bishop
was bold enough to make his choice between them all. His
opinion was that the dwelling-place of the first man was
situated between the Tigris and Euphrates, above the place
where they separate before falling into the Persian Gulf;
and, founding this opinion on very extensive reading, he
declared that of all his predecessors, Calvin had come nearest
to the truth.</p>

<p>Among the other authors of greater or less celebrity that
have occupied themselves in this question, we may instance
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Raban Maur (ninth century) believed that the terrestrial
paradise was at the eastern extremity of the earth. He
described the tree of life, and added that there was
neither heat nor cold in that garden; that immense rivers of
water nourished all the forest; and that the paradise was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
surrounded by a wall of fire, and its four rivers watered
the earth.</p>

<p>James of Vitry supposed Pison to come out of the terrestrial
paradise. He describes also the garden of Eden; and,
like all the cosmographers of the middle ages, he placed
it in the most easterly portion of the world in an inaccessible
place, and surrounded by a wall of fire, which
rose up to heaven.</p>

<p>Dati placed also the terrestrial paradise in Asia, like
the cosmographers that preceded him, and made the Nile
come from the east. Stenchus, the librarian of St. Si&eacute;ge,
who lived in the sixteenth century, devoted several years to
the problem, but discovered nothing. The celebrated orientalist
and missionary Bochart wrote a treatise on this subject
in 1650. Th&eacute;venot published also in the seventeenth
century a map representing the country of the Lybians, and
adds that "several great doctors place the terrestrial paradise
there."</p>

<p>An Armenian writer who translated and borrowed from
St. Epiphanius (eighth century) produced a <i>Memorial on the
Four Rivers of the Terrestrial Paradise</i>. He supposes they
rise in the unknown land of the Amazons, whence also arise
the Danube and the Hellespont, and they deliver their waters
into that great sea that is the source of all seas, and which
surrounds the four quarters of the globe. He afterwards
says, following up the same theory, that the rivers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
paradise surround the world and enter again into the sea,
which is the universal ocean."</p>

<p>Gervais and Robert of St. Marien d'Auxerre taught that the
terrestrial paradise was on the eastern border of the <i>square</i>
which formed the world. Alain de Lille, who lived in the
thirteenth century, maintained in his <i>Anticlaudianus</i> that
the earth is circular, and the garden of Eden is in the east
of Asia. Joinville, the friend of St. Louis, gives us a curious
notion of his geographical ideas, since, with regard to paradise,
he assures us that the four great rivers of the south come out
of it, as do the spices. "Here," he says, referring to the
Nile, "it is advisable to speak of the river which passes by
the countries of Egypt, and comes from the terrestrial
paradise. Where this river enters Egypt there are people
very expert and experienced, as thieves are here, at stealing
from the river, who in the evening throw their nets on the
streams and rivers, and in the morning they often find and
carry off the spices which are sold here in Europe as coming
from Egypt at a good rate, and by weight, such as cinnamon,
ginger, rhubarb, cloves, lignum, aloes, and several other good
things, and they say that these good things come <i>from the
terrestrial paradise</i>, and that the wind blows them off the
trees that are growing there." And he says that near the
end of the world are the peoples of Gog and Magog, who
will come at the end of the world with Antichrist.</p>

<p>We find, however, more than descriptions&mdash;we have repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>sentations
of the terrestrial paradise by cartographers of the
middle ages, some of which we have seen in speaking of
their general ideas of geography, and we will now introduce
others.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;Paradise of Fra Mauro.</span>
</div>

<p>Fra Mauro, a religious cosmographer of the fifteenth century,
gives on the east side of a map of the world a representation
which shows us that at that epoch the "garden of
delights" had become very barren. It is a vast plain, on
which we see Jehovah and the first human couple, with a
circular rampart surrounding it. The four rivers flow out of
it by bifurcating. An angel protects the principal gate, which
cannot be reached but by crossing barren mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>The cosmographical map of Gervais, dedicated to the
Emperor Otho IV., shows the terrestrial paradise in the
centre of the earth, which is square, and is situated in the
midst of the seas. Adam and Eve appear in consultation.</p>

<p>The map of the world prepared by Andreas Bianco, in the
fifteenth century, represents Eden, Adam and Eve, and the
tree of life. On the left, on a peninsula, are seen the reprobated
people of Gog and Magog, who are to accompany
Antichrist. Alexander is also represented there, but without
apparent reason. The paradisaical peninsula has a building
on it with this inscription, "Ospitius Macarii."</p>

<p>Formalconi says, on this subject, that a certain Macarius
lives near paradise, who is a witness to all that the author
states, and as Bianco has indicated, his cell was close to the
gates of paradise.</p>

<p>This legend has reference to the pilgrims of St. Macarius, a
tradition that was spread on the return of the Crusaders, of
three monks who undertook a voyage to discover the point
where the earth and heaven meet, that is to say, the place of
the terrestrial paradise. The map of Rudimentum, a vast
compilation published at L&uuml;beck in 1475 by the Dominican
Brocard, represents the terrestrial paradise surrounded by
walls, but it is less sterile that in the last picture, as may
be seen on the next page.</p>

<p>In the year 1503, when Varthema, the adventurous Bolognian,
went to the Indies by the route of Palestine and Syria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
he was shown the evil-reputed house which Cain dwelt in,
which was not far from the terrestrial paradise. Master
Gilius, the learned naturalist who travelled at the expense
of Francis I., had the same satisfaction. The simple faith
of our ancestors had no hesitation in accepting such
arch&aelig;ology.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 54.&mdash;The Paradise of the Fifteenth Century.</span>
</div>

<p>The most curious and interesting of all attempts to discover
the situation of paradise was that made half unconsciously
by Columbus when he first found the American shore.</p>

<p>In his third voyage, when for the first time he reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
main land, he was persuaded not only that he had arrived at
the extremity of Asia, but that he could not be far from the
position of paradise. The Orinoco seemed to be one of those
four great rivers which, according to tradition, came out of
the garden inhabited by our first parents, and his hopes
were supported by the fragrant breezes that blew from the
beautiful forests on its banks. This, he thought, was but the
entrance to the celestial dwelling-place, and if he had dared&mdash;if
a religious fear had not held back him who had risked
everything amidst the elements and amongst men, he would
have liked to push forward to where he might hope to find
the celestial boundaries of the world, and, a little further, to
have bathed his eyes, with profound humility, in the light of
the flaming swords which were wielded by two seraphim
before the gate of Eden.</p>

<p>He thus expresses himself on this subject in his letter to
one of the monarchs of Spain, dated Hayti, October, 1498.
"The Holy Scriptures attest that the Lord created paradise,
and placed in it the tree of life, and made the four great rivers
of the earth to pass out of it, the Ganges of India, the
Tigris, the Euphrates (passing from the mountains to form
Mesopotamia, and ending in Persia), and the Nile, which
rises in Ethiopia and goes to the Sea of Alexander. I
cannot, nor have been ever able to find in the books of the
Latins or Greeks anything authentic on the site of this
terrestrial paradise, nor do I see anything more certain in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the maps of the world. Some place it at the source of the
Nile, in Ethiopia; but the travellers who have passed
through those countries have not found either in the mildness
of the climate or in the elevation of the site towards
heaven anything that could lead to the presumption that
paradise was there, and that the waters of the Deluge were
unable to reach it or cover it. Several pagans have written
for the purpose of proving it was in the Fortunate Isles, which
are the Canaries. St. Isidore, Bede, and Strabo, St. Ambrosius,
Scotus, and all judicious theologians affirm with one accord
that paradise was in the East. It is from thence only that
the enormous quantity of water can come, seeing that the
course of the rivers is extremely long; and these waters (of
paradise) arrive here, where I am, and form a lake. There
are great signs here of the neighbourhood of the terrestrial
paradise, for the site is entirely conformable to the opinion of
the saints and judicious theologians. The climate is of admirable
mildness. I believe that if I passed beneath the equinoctial
line, and arrived at the highest point of which I have
spoken, I should find a milder temperature, and a change in
the stars and the waters; not that I believe that the point
where the greatest height is situated is navigable, or even
that there is water there, or that one could reach it, but I
am convinced that <i>there</i> is the terrestrial paradise, where no
one can come except by the will of God."</p>

<p>In the opinion of this illustrious navigator the earth had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the form of a pear, and its surface kept rising towards the
east, indicated by the point of the fruit. It was there that he
supposed might be found the garden where ancient tradition
imagined the creation of the first human couple was accomplished.</p>

<p>We can scarcely think without astonishment of the great
amount of darkness that obscured scientific knowledge,
when this great man appeared on the scene of the world, nor
of the rapidity with which the obscurity and vagueness of
ideas were dissipated almost immediately after his marvellous
discoveries. Scarcely had a half century elapsed after his
death, than all the geographical fables of the middle ages did
no more than excite smiles of incredulity, although during
his life the universal opinion was not much advanced upon
the times of the famous knight John of Mandeville, who
wrote gravely as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No mortal man can go to or approach this paradise. By
land no one can go there on account of savage beasts which
are in the deserts, and because of mountains and rocks that
cannot be passed over, and dark places without number; nor
can one go there any better by sea; the water rushes so wildly,
it comes in so great waves, that no vessel dare sail against
them. The water is so rapid, and makes so great a noise and
tempest, that no one can hear however loud he is spoken to,
and so when some great men with good courage have
attempted several times to go by this river to paradise, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
large companies, they have never been able to accomplish
their journey. On the contrary, many have died with fatigue
in swimming against the watery waves. Many others have
become blind, others have become deaf by the noise of the
water, and others have been suffocated and lost in the waves,
so that no mortal man can approach it except by the special
grace of God."</p>

<p>With one notable exception, no attempts have been made of
late years to solve such a question. That exception is by the
noble and indefatigable Livingstone, who declared his conviction
to Sir Roderick Murchison, in a letter published in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, that paradise was situated somewhere near the
sources of the Nile.</p>

<p>Those generally who now seek an answer to the question
of the birthplace of the human race do not call it paradise.</p>

<p>Since man is here, and there was a time quite recent,
geologically speaking, when he was not, there must have
been some actual locality on the earth's surface where he was
first a man. Whether we have, or even can hope to have,
enough information to indicate where that locality was
situated, is a matter of doubt. We have not at present. Those
who have attended most to the subject appear to think some
island the most probable locality, but it is quite conjectural.</p>

<p>The name "Paradise" appears to have been derived from
the Persian, in which it means a garden; similarly derived
words express the same idea in other languages; as in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Hebrew <i>pard&ecirc;s</i>, in the Arabian <i>firdaus</i>, in the Syriac <i>pardiso</i>,
and in the Armenian <i>partes</i>. It has been thought that the
Persian word itself is derived from the Sanscrit <i>pradesa</i>, or
<i>paradesa</i>, which means a circle, a country, or strange region;
which, though near enough as to sound, does not quite agree
as to meaning. "Eden" is from a Hebrew root meaning
delights.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>ECLIPSES AND COMETS.</h3>


<p>We have seen in the earlier chapters on the systems of the
ancients and their ideas of the world how everything was
once supposed to have exclusive reference to man, and how he
considered himself not only chief of animate objects, but
that his own city was the centre of the material world, and
his own world the centre of the material universe; that the
sun was made to shine, as well as the moon and stars, for his
benefit; and that, were it not for him they would have
no reason for existence. And we have seen how, step
by step, these illusions have been dispelled, and he has
learnt to appreciate his own littleness in proportion as
he has realised the immensity of the universe of which he
forms part.</p>

<p>If such has been his history, and such his former ideas on
the regular parts, as we may call them, of nature, much more
have similar ideas been developed in relation to those other
phenomena which, coming at such long intervals, have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
been recognised by him as periodic, but have seemed to have
some relation to mundane affairs, often of the smallest consequence.
Such are eclipses of the sun and moon, comets,
shooting-stars, and meteors. Among the less instructed of
men, even when astronomers of the same age and nation
knew their real nature, eclipses have always been looked upon
as something ominous of evil.</p>

<p>Among the ancient nations people used to come to the
assistance of the moon, by making a confused noise with all
kinds of instruments, when it was eclipsed. It is even done
now in Persia and some parts of China, where they fancy
that the moon is fighting with a great dragon, and they think
the noise will make him loose his hold and take to flight.
Among the East Indians they have the same belief that
when the sun and the moon are eclipsed, a dragon is seizing
them, and astronomers who go there to observe eclipses
are troubled by the fears of their native attendants, and by
their endeavours to get into the water as the best place under
the circumstances. In America the idea is that the sun and
moon are tired when they are eclipsed. But the more refined
Greeks believed for a long time that the moon was bewitched,
and that the magicians made it descend from heaven, to put
into the herbs a certain maleficent froth. Perhaps the idea
of the Dragon arose from the ancient custom of calling the
places in the heavens at which the eclipses of the moon took
place the head and tail of the Dragon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>In ancient history we have many curious instances of the
very critical influence that eclipses have had, especially in
the case of events in a campaign, where it was thought
unfavourable to some projected attempt.</p>

<p>Thus an eclipse of the moon was the original cause of the
death of the Athenian general Nicias. Just at a critical
juncture, when he was about to depart from the harbour
of Syracuse, the eclipse filled him and his whole army
with dismay. The result of his terror was that he delayed
the departure of his fleet, and the Athenian army was
cut in pieces and destroyed, and Nicias lost his liberty
and life.</p>

<p>Plutarch says they could understand well enough the
cause of the eclipse of the sun by the interposition of the
moon, but they could not imagine by the opposition of what
body the moon itself could be eclipsed.</p>

<p>One of the most famous eclipses of antiquity was that of
Thales, recorded by Herodotus, who says:&mdash;"The Lydians
and the Medes were at war for five consecutive years. Now
while the war was sustained on both sides with equal chance,
in the sixth year, one day when the armies were in battle
array, it happened that in the midst of the combat the day
suddenly changed into night. Thales of Miletus had predicted
this phenomenon to the Ionians, and had pointed out
precisely that very year as the one in which it would take
place. The Lydians and Medes, seeing the night succeeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
suddenly to the day, put an end to the combat, and only cared
to establish peace."</p>

<p>Another notable eclipse is that related by Diodorus Siculus.
It was a total eclipse of the sun, which took place while
Agathocles, fleeing from the port of Syracuse, where he
was blockaded by the Carthaginians, was hastening to gain
the coast of Africa. "When Agathocles was already surrounded
by the enemy, night came on, and he escaped
contrary to all hope. On the day following so complete an
eclipse of the sun took place that it seemed altogether night,
for the stars shone out in all places. The soldiers therefore
of Agathocles, persuaded that the gods were intending them
some misfortune, were in the greatest perturbation about the
future. Agathocles was equal to the occasion. When disembarked
in Africa, where, in spite of all his fine words, he was
unable to reassure his soldiers, whom the eclipse of the
sun had frightened, he changed his tactics, and pretending
to understand the prodigy, "I grant, comrades," he said,
"that had we perceived this, eclipse before our embarkation
we should indeed have been in a critical situation, but now
that we have seen it after our departure, and as it always
signifies a change in the present state of affairs, it
follows that our circumstances, which were very bad in
Sicily, are about to amend, while we shall indubitably ruin
those of the Carthaginians, which have been hitherto so
flourishing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>We are reminded by this of the story of Pericles, who,
when ready to set sail with his fleet on a great expedition,
saw himself stopped by a similar phenomenon. He spread
his mantle over the eyes of the pilot, whom fear had prevented
acting, and asked him if that was any sign of misfortune,
when the pilot answered in the negative. "What
misfortune then do you suppose," said he, "is presaged by
the body that hides the sun, which differs from this in
nothing but being larger?"</p>

<p>With reference to these eclipses, when their locality
and approximate date is known, astronomy comes to the
assistance of history, and can supply the exact day, and
even hour, of the occurrence. For the eclipses depend on
the motions of the moon, and just as astronomers can calculate
both the time and the path of a solar eclipse in the
future, so they can for the past. If then the eclipses are
calculated back to the epoch when the particular one
is recorded, it can be easily ascertained which one it
was that about that time passed over the spot at which
it was observed, and as soon as the particular eclipse
is fixed upon, it may be told at what hour it would be
seen.</p>

<p>Thus the eclipse of Thales has been assigned by different
authors to various dates, between the 1st of October, 583 <small>B.C.</small>,
and the 3rd of February, 626 <small>B.C.</small> The only eclipse of the sun
that is suitable between those dates has been found by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Astronomer-Royal to be that which would happen in Lydia on
the 28th of May, 585 <small>B.C.</small>, which must therefore be the date
of the event.</p>

<p>So of the eclipse of Agathocles, M. Delaunay has fixed
its date to the 15th August, 310 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>In later days, when Christopher Columbus had to deal
with the ignorant people of America, the same kind of story
was repeated. He found himself reduced to famine by the
inhabitants of the country, who kept him and his companions
prisoners; and being aware of the approach of the eclipse, he
menaced them with bringing upon them great misfortunes,
and depriving them of the light of the moon, if they did not
instantly bring him provisions. They cared little for his
menaces at first; but as soon as they saw the moon disappear,
they ran to him with abundance of victuals, and implored
pardon of the conqueror. This was on the 1st of March,
1504, a date which may be tested by the modern tables of
the moon, and Columbus's account proved to be correct.
The eclipse was indeed recorded in other places by various
observers.</p>

<p>Eclipses in their natural aspect have thus had considerable
influence on the vulgar, who knew nothing of their cause.
This of course was the state with all in the early ages, and
it is interesting to trace the gradual progress from their being
quite unexpected to their being predicted.</p>

<p>It is very probable, if not certain, that their recurrence in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the case of the moon at least was recognised long before their
nature was understood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Chinese they were long calculated, and, in fact,
it is thought by some that they have pretended to a greater
antiquity by calculating backwards, and recording as observed
eclipses those which happened before they understood or noticed
them. It seems, however, authenticated that they did in the
year 2169 <small>B.C.</small> observe an eclipse of the sun, and that at that
date they were in the habit of predicting them. For this
particular eclipse is said to have cost several of the astronomers
their lives, as they had not calculated it rightly. As
the lives of princes were supposed to be dependent on these
eclipses, it became high treason to expose them to such a
danger without forewarning them. They paid more attention
to the eclipses of the sun than of the moon.</p>

<p>Among the Babylonians the eclipses of the moon were
observed from a very early date, and numerous records of
them are contained in the Observations of Bel in Sargon's
library, the tablets of which have lately been discovered.
In the older portion they only record that on the 14th
day of such and such a (lunar) month an eclipse takes
place, and state in what watch it begins, and when it ends.
In a later portion the observations were more precise, and the
descriptions of the eclipse more accurate. Long before
1700 <small>B.C.</small> the discovery of the lunar cycle of 223 lunar
months had been made, and by means of it they were able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
to state of each lunar eclipse, that it was either "according
to calculation" or "contrary to calculation."</p>

<p>They dealt also with solar eclipses, and tried to trace on
a sphere the path they would take on the earth. Accordingly,
like the eclipses of the moon, these too were spoken of
as happening either "according to calculation" or "contrary
to calculation." "In a report sent in to one of the later
kings of Assyria by the state astronomer, Abil Islar states
that a watch had been kept on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of
Sivan, or May, for an eclipse of the sun, which did not,
however, take place after all. The shadow, it is clear, must
have fallen outside the field of observation." Besides the
more ordinary kind of solar eclipses, mention is made in the
Observations of Bel of annular eclipses which, strangely
enough, are seldom alluded to by classical writers.</p>

<p>A record of a later eclipse has been found by Sir
Henry Rawlinson on one of the Nineveh Tablets. This
occurred near that city in <small>B.C.</small> 763, and from the character
of the inscription it may be inferred that it was a rare
occurrence with them, indeed that it was nearly, if not
quite, a total eclipse. This has an especial interest as
being the earliest that we have any approximate date
for.</p>

<p>It is possible that the remarkable phenomenon, alluded to
by the prophet Isaiah, of the shadow going backwards ten
degrees on the dial of Ahaz, may be really a record of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
eclipse of the sun, such as astronomy proves to have occurred
at Jerusalem in the year 689 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>We have very little notice of the calculation of eclipses by
the Egyptians; all that is told us is more or less fabulous.
Thus Diogenes Laertius says that they reckoned that during
a period of 48,863 years, 373 eclipses of the sun and 832
eclipses of the moon had occurred, which is far fewer than
the right number for so long a time, and which, of course,
has no basis in fact.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, Anaxagoras was the first who entertained
clear ideas about the nature of eclipses; and it was
from him that Pericles learnt their harmlessness.</p>

<p>Plutarch relates that Helicon of Cyzicus predicted an
eclipse of the sun to Dionysius of Syracuse, and received
as a reward a talent of silver.</p>

<p>Livy records an eclipse of the sun as having taken place
on the 11th of Quintilis, which corresponds to the 11th
of July. It happened during the Appollinarian games,
190 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The same author tells us of an eclipse of the moon that
was predicted by one Gallus, a tribune of the second legion,
on the eve of the battle of Pydna&mdash;a prediction which was
duly fulfilled on the following night. The fact of its having
been foretold quieted the superstitious fears of the soldiers,
and gave them a very high opinion of Gallus. Other
authors, among them Cicero, do not give so flattering a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
story, but state that Gallus's part consisted only in explaining
the cause of the eclipse after it had happened. The date
of this eclipse was the 3rd of September, 168 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>Ennius, writing towards the end of the second century
<small>B.C.</small>, describes an eclipse which was said to have happened
nearly two hundred years before (404, <small>B.C.</small>), in the following
remarkable words:&mdash;"On the nones of July the moon
passed over the sun, and there was night." Aristarchus,
three centuries before Christ, understood and explained the
nature of eclipses; but the chief of the ancient authors
upon this subject was Hipparchus. He and his disciples
were able to predict eclipses with considerable accuracy,
both as to their time and duration. Geminus and
Cleomedes were two other writers, somewhat later, who
explained and predicted eclipses. In later times regular
tables were drawn up, showing when the eclipses would
happen. One that Ptolemy was the author of was founded
on data derived from ancient observers&mdash;Callipus, Democritus,
Eudoxus, Hipparchus&mdash;aided by his own calculations.
After the days of Ptolemy the knowledge of the eclipses
advanced <i>pari passu</i> with the advance of astronomy generally.
So long as astronomy itself was empirical, the time of
the return of an eclipse was only reckoned by the intervals
that had elapsed during the same portion of previous cycles;
but after the discovery of elliptic orbits and the force
of gravitation the whole motion of the moon could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
calculated with as great accuracy as any other astronomical
phenomenon.</p>

<p>In point of fact, if the new moon is in the plane of the
ecliptic there must be an eclipse of the sun; if the full
moon is there, there must be an eclipse of the moon; and
if it should in these cases be only partially in that plane,
the eclipses also will be partial. The cycle of changes that
the position of the moon can undergo when new and full
occupies a period of eighteen years and eleven days, in
which period there are forty-one eclipses of the sun and
twenty-nine of the moon. Each year there are at most seven
and at least two eclipses; if only two, they are eclipses of the
sun. Although more numerous in reality for the whole
earth, eclipses of the sun are more rarely observed in any
particular place, because they are not seen everywhere, but
only where the shadow of the moon passes; while all that
part of the earth that sees the moon at all at the time sees
it eclipsed.</p>

<p>We now come to comets.</p>

<p>The ancients divided comets into different classes, the
chief points of distinction being derived from the shape,
length, and brilliancy of the tails. Pliny distinguished
twelve kinds, which he thus characterised:&mdash;"Some frighten
us by their blood-coloured mane; their bristling hair rises
towards the heaven. The bearded ones let their long hair
fall down like a majestic beard.  The javelin-shaped ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
seem to be projected forwards like a dart, as they rapidly
attain their shape after their first appearance; if the tail is
shorter, and terminates in a point, it is called a sword; this is
the palest of all the comets; it has the appearance of a bright
sword without any diverging rays. The plate or disc derives
its name from its shape, its colour is that of amber, it gives
out some diverging rays from its sides, but not in large
quantity. The cask has really the form of a cask, which
one might suppose to be staved in smoke enveloped in
light. The retort imitates the figure of a horn, and the
lamp that of a burning flame. The horse-comet represents
the mane of a horse which is violently agitated, as by a
circular, or rather cylindrical, motion. Such a comet appears
also of singular whiteness, with hair of a silver hue; it is
so bright that one can scarcely look at it. There are bristling
comets, they are like the skins of beasts with their hair on,
and are surrounded by a nebulosity. Lastly, the hair of the
comet sometimes takes the form of a lance."</p>

<p>Pingr&eacute;, a celebrated historian of comets, tells us that one
of the first comets noticed in history is that which appeared
over Rome forty years before Christ, and in which the Roman
people imagined they saw the soul of C&aelig;sar endowed with
divine honours. Next comes that which threw its light on
Jerusalem when it was being besieged and remained for a
whole year above the city, according to the account of
Josephus. It was of this kind that Pliny said it "is of so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
great a whiteness that one can scarcely look at it, and <i>one
may see in it the image of God in human form</i>."</p>

<p>Diodorus tells us that, a little after the subversion of the
towns of Helix and Bura, there were seen, for several nights
in succession, a brilliant light, which was called a beam of
fire, but which Aristotle says was a true comet.</p>

<p>Plutarch, in his life of Timoleon, says a burning flame
preceded the fleet of this general until his arrival at Sicily,
and that during the consulate of Caius Servilius a bright
shield was seen suspended in the heavens.</p>

<p>The historians Sazoncenas and Socrates relate that in
the year 400 <small>A.D.</small> a comet in the form of a sword shone over
Constantinople, and appeared to touch the town just at the
time when great misfortunes were impending through the
treachery of Gainas.</p>

<p>The same phenomenon appeared over Rome previous to
the arrival of Alaric.</p>

<p>In fact the ancient chroniclers always associated the
appearance of a comet with some terrestrial event, which
it was not difficult to do, seeing that critical situations
were at all times existing in some one country or other
where the comet would be visible, and probably those which
could not be connected with any were not thought worthy
of being recorded.</p>

<p>It is well known that the year 1000 <small>A.D.</small> was for a long
time predicted to be the end of the world. In this year the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
astronomers and chroniclers registered the fall of an enormous
burning meteor and the appearance of a comet. Pingr&eacute; says:
"On the 19th of the calends of January"&mdash;that is the 14th of
December&mdash;"the heavens being dark, a kind of burning sword
fell to the earth, leaving behind it a long train of light. Its
brilliancy was such that it frightened not only those who
were in the fields, but even those who were shut up in their
houses. This great opening in the heavens was gradually
closed, and then was seen the figure of a dragon, whose feet
were blue, and whose head kept continually increasing. A
comet having appeared at the same time as this chasm, or
meteor, they were confounded." This relation is given in the
chronicles of Seigbert in Hermann Corner, in the Chronique
de Tours, in Albert Casin, and other historians of the time.</p>

<p>Bodin, resuscitating an idea of Democritus, wrote that the
comets were the souls of illustrious personages, who, after
having lived on the earth a long series of centuries, and being
ready at last to pass away, were carried in a kind of triumph
to heaven. For this reason, famine, epidemics, and civil wars
followed on the apparition of comets, the towns and their
inhabitants finding themselves then deprived of the help of
the illustrious souls who had laboured to appease their
intestinal feuds.</p>

<p>One of the comets of the middle ages which made the
greatest impression on the minds of the people was that
which appeared during Holy Week of the year 837, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
frightened Louis the Debonnaire. The first morning of its
appearance he sent for his astrologer. "Go," he said, "on to
the terrace of the palace, and come back again immediately
and tell me what you have seen, for I have not seen that star
before, and you have not shown it to me; but I know that this
sign is a comet: it announces a change of reign and the death
of a prince." The son of Charlemagne having taken counsel
with his bench of bishops, was convinced that the comet was
a notice sent from heaven expressly for him. He passed the
nights in prayer, and gave large donations to the monasteries,
and finally had a number of masses performed out of fear
for himself and forethought for the Church committed to his
care. The comet, however, was a very inoffensive one, being
none other than that known as Halley's comet, which returned
in 1835. While they were being thus frightened in
France, the Chinese were observing it astronomically.</p>

<p>The historian of Merlin the enchanter relates that a few days
after the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> which were held on the occasion of the erection
of the funeral monument of Salisbury, a sign appeared in
heaven. It was a comet of large size and excessive splendour.
It resembled a dragon, out of whose mouth came a long two-forked
tongue, one part of which turned towards the north
and the other to the east. The people were in a state of
fear, each one asking what this sign presaged. Uter, in
the absence of the king, Ambrosius, his brother, who was
engaged in pursuing one of the sons of Vortigern, consulted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
all the wise men of Britain, but no one could give him any
answer. Then he thought of Merlin the enchanter, and sent
for him to the court. "What does this apparition presage?"
demanded the king's brother. Merlin began to weep. "O son
of Britain, you have just had a great loss&mdash;the king is dead."
After a moment of silence he added, "But the Britons have
still a king. Haste thee, Uter, attack the enemy. All the
island will submit to you, for the figure of the fiery dragon
is thyself. The ray that goes towards Gaul represents a son
who shall be born to thee, who will be great by his achievements,
and not less so by his power. The ray that goes
towards Ireland represents a daughter of whom thou shalt
be the father, and her sons and grandsons shall reign over all
the Britons." These predictions were realised; but it is
more than probable that they were made up after the event.</p>

<p>The comet of 1066 was regarded as a presage of the
Conquest under William of Normandy. In the Bayeaux
tapestry, on which Matilda of Flanders had drawn all the
most memorable episodes in the transmarine expedition of
her husband, the comet appears in one of the corners with
the inscription, <i>Isti mirantur stellam</i>, which proves that the
comet was considered a veritable marvel. It is said even to
be traditionally reported that one of the jewels of the British
crown was taken from the tail of this comet. Nevertheless
it was no more than Halley's comet again in its periodical
visit every seventy-six years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>In July, 1214, a brilliant comet appeared which was lost
to view on the same day as the Pope, Urban IV., died, <i>i.e.</i>
the third of October.</p>

<p>In June, 1456, a similar body of enormous size, with
a very long and extraordinarily bright tail, put all Christendom
in a fright. The Pope, Calixtus III., was engaged in
a war at that time with the Saracens. He showed the
Christians that the comet "had the form of a cross," and
announced some great event. At the same time Mahomet
announced to his followers that the comet, "having the form
of a yataghan," was a blessing of the Prophet's. It is said
that the Pope afterwards recognised that it had this form,
and excommunicated it. Nevertheless, the Christians obtained
the victory under the walls of Belgrade. This was
another appearance of Halley's comet.</p>

<p>In the early months of 1472 appeared a large comet, which
historians agree in saying was very horrible and alarming.
Belleforest said it was a hideous and frightening comet, which
threw its rays from east to west, giving great cause for fear
to great people, who were not ignorant that comets are the
menacing rods of God, which admonish those who are in
authority, that they may be converted.</p>

<p>Pingr&eacute;, who has told us of so many of the comets that
were seen before his time, wrote of this epoch: "Comets
became the most efficacious signs of the most important and
doubtful events.  They were charged to announce wars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
seditions, and the internal movements of republics; they
presaged famines, pestilence, and epidemics; princes, or even
persons of dignity, could not pay the tribute of nature
without the previous appearance of that universal oracle,
a comet; men could no longer be surprised by any unexpected
event; the future might be as easily read in the
heavens as the past in history. Their effect depended on the
place in the heavens where they shone, the countries over
which they directly lay, the signs of the zodiac that they
measured by their longitude, the constellations they traversed,
the form and length of their tails, the place where they went
out, and a thousand other circumstances more easily indicated
than distinguished; they also announced in general wars, and
the death of princes, or some grand personage, but there
were few years that passed without something of this kind
occurring. The devout astrologers&mdash;for there were many of
that sort&mdash;risked less than the others. According to them,
the comet threatened some misfortune; if it did not happen,
it was because the prayers of penitence had turned aside the
wrath of God; he had returned his sword to the scabbard.
But a rule was invented which gave the astrologers free
scope, for they said that events announced by a comet might
be postponed for one or more periods of forty years, or even
as many years as the comet had appeared days; so that one
which had appeared for six months need not produce its
effect for 180 years."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Representation of a Comet, 16th Century.</span>
</div>

<p>The most frightful of the comets of this period, according
to Simon Goulart, was that of 1527. "It put some into so
great a fright that they died; others fell sick. It was seen
by several thousand people, and appeared very long, and of
the colour of blood. At the summit was seen the representation
of a curved arm, holding a large sword in its hand, as
if it would strike; at the top of the point of the sword
were three stars, but that which touched the point was
more brilliant than the others. On the two sides of the
rays of this comet were seen large hatchets, poignards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
bloody swords, among which were seen a great number of
men decapitated, having their heads and beards horribly
bristling."</p>

<p>A view of this comet is given in the <i>History of Prodigies</i>.</p>

<p>There was another comet remarked in 1556, and another
in 1577, like the head of an owl, followed by a mantle of
scattered light, with pointed ends. Of this comet we read
in the same book that recorded the last described: "The
comet is an infallible sign of a very evil event. Whenever
eclipses of the sun or moon, or comets, or earthquakes,
conversions of water into blood, and such like prodigies
happen, it has always been known that very soon after these
miserable portents afflictions, effusion of human blood, massacres,
deaths of great monarchs, kings, princes, and rulers, seditions,
treacheries, raids, overthrowings of empires, kingdoms,
or villages; hunger and scarcity of provisions, burning and
overthrowing of towns; pestilences, widespread mortality,
both of beasts and men; in fact all sorts of evils and misfortunes
take place. Nor can it be doubted that all these
signs and prodigies give warning that the end of the world
is come, and with it the terrible last judgment of God."</p>

<p>But even now comets were being observed astronomically,
and began to lose their sepulchral aspect.</p>

<p>A remarkable comet, however, which appeared in 1680,
was not without its fears for the vulgar. We are told that it
was recognised as the same which appeared the year of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
C&aelig;sar's death, then in 531, and afterwards in 1106, having
a period of about 575 years. The terror it produced in the
towns was great; timid spirits saw in it the sign of a new
deluge, as they said water was always announced by fire.
While the fearful were making their wills, and, in anticipation
of the end of the world, were leaving their money to the
monks, who in accepting them showed themselves better
physicists than the testators, people in high station were
asking what great person it heralded the death of, and it is
reported of the brother of Louis XIV., who apparently was
afraid of becoming too suddenly like C&aelig;sar, that he said
sharply to the courtiers who were discussing it, "Ah,
gentlemen, you may talk at your ease, if you please; you
are not princes."</p>

<p>This same comet gave rise to a curious story of an "extraordinary
prodigy, how at Rome a hen laid an egg on which
was drawn a picture of the comet.</p>

<p>"The fact was attested by his Holiness, by the Queen of
Sweden, and all the persons of first quality in Rome. On
the 4th December, 1680, a hen laid an egg on which was
seen the figure of the comet, accompanied by other marks
such as are here represented. The cleverest naturalists in
Rome have seen and examined it, and have never seen such
a prodigy before."</p>

<p>Of this same comet Bernouilli wrote, "<i>That if the body of
the comet is not a visible sign of the anger of God, the tail may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
be</i>." It was this too that suggested to Whiston the idea that
he put forward, not as a superstitious, but as a physical
speculation, that a comet approaching the earth was the cause
of the deluge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/376.jpg" width="336" height="336" alt="Fig. 56." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;An Egg Marked with a Comet.</span>
</div>

<p>The last blow to the superstitious fear of the comets was
given by Halley, when he proved that they circulated like
planets round the sun, and that the comets noticed in 837,
1066, 1378, 1456, 1531, 1607, 1682 were all one, whose period
was about 76 years, and which would return in 1759, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
prediction was verified, and the comet went afterwards by
the name of this astronomer. It returned again in 1835,
and will revisit us in 1911.</p>

<p>Even after the fear arising from the relics of astrology had
died away, another totally different alarm was connected with
comets&mdash;an alarm which has not entirely subsided even in
our own times. This is that a comet may come in contact
with the earth and destroy it by the collision. The most
remarkable panic in this respect was that which arose in
Paris in 1773. At the previous meeting of the Academy of
Sciences, M. Lalande was to have read an interesting paper,
but the time failed. It was on the subject of comets that
could, by approaching the earth, cause its destruction, with
special reference to the one that was soon to come. From
the title only of the paper the most dreadful fears were
spread abroad, and, increasing day by day, were with great
difficulty allayed. The house of M. Lalande was filled with
those who came to question him on the memoir in question.
The fermentation was so great that some devout people, as
ignorant as weak, asked the archbishop to make a forty
hours' prayer to turn away the enormous deluge that they
feared, and the prelate was nearly going to order these prayers,
if the members of the Academy had not persuaded him how
ridiculous it would be. Finally, M. Lalande, finding it impossible
to answer all the questions put to him about his
fatal memoir, and wishing to prevent the real evils that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
might arise from the frightened imaginations of the weak,
caused it to be printed, and made it as clear as was possible.
When it appeared, it was found that he stated that of the
sixty comets known there were eight which could, by coming
too near the earth, say within 40,000 miles, occasion such
a pressure that the sea would leave its bed and cover part
of the globe, but that in any case this could not happen
till after twenty years. This was too long to make it
worth while to make provision for it, and the effervescence
subsided.</p>

<p>A similar case to this occurred with respect to Biela's
comet, which was to return in 1832. In calculating its reappearance
in this year, Damoiseau found that it would pass
through the plane of the earth's orbit on the 29th of October.
Rushing away with this, the papers made out that a collision
was inevitable, and the end of the world was come. But no
one thought to inquire where the earth would be when
the comet passed through the plane in which it revolved.
Arago, however, set people's minds at rest by pointing out
that at that time the earth would be a month's journey
from the spot, which with the rate at which the earth is
moving would correspond to a distance of sixty millions
of miles.</p>

<p>This, like other frights, passed away, but was repeated
again in 1840 and 1857 with like results, and even in 1872
a similar end to the world was announced to the public for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the 12th of August, on the supposed authority of a Professor
at Geneva, but who had never said what was supposed.</p>

<p>But in reality all cause of fear has now passed away,
since it has been proved that the comet is made of gaseous
matter in a state of extreme tenuity, so that, though it may
make great show in the heavens, the whole mass may not
weigh more than a few pounds; and we have in addition
the testimony of experience, which might have been relied
on on the occasions above referred to, for in 1770 Lexele's
comet was seen to pass through the satellites of Jupiter
without deranging them in the least, but was itself thrown
entirely out of its path, while there is reason to believe that
on the 29th of June, 1861, the earth remained several hours
in the tail of a comet without having experienced the
slightest inconvenience.</p>

<p>As to the nature of comets, the opinions that have been
held have been mostly very vague. Metrodorus thought
they were reflections from the sun; Democritus, a concourse
of several stars; Aristotle, a collection of exhalations which
had become dry and inflamed; Strabo, that they are the
splendour of a star enveloped in a cloud; Heracletes of
Pontus, an elevated cloud which gave out much light;
Epigenes, some terrestrial matter that had caught fire, and
was agitated by the wind; B&#339;cius, part of the air, coloured;
Anaxagoras, sparks fallen from the elementary fire; Xenophanes,
a motion and spreading out of clouds which caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
fire; and Descartes, the d&eacute;bris of vortices that had
been destroyed, the fragments of which were coming
towards us.</p>

<p>It is said that the Chald&aelig;ans held the opinion that they
were analogous to planets by their regular course, and that
when we ceased to see them, it was because they had
gone too far from us; and Seneca followed this explanation,
since he regarded them as globes turning in the heavens,
and which appear and disappear in certain times, and
whose periodical motions might be known by regular
observation.</p>

<p>We have thus traced the particular ideas that have
attached themselves to eclipses and comets, as the two
most remarkable of the extraordinary phenomena of the
heavens, and have seen how the fears and superstitions of
mankind have been inevitably linked with them in the
earlier days of ignorance and darkness, but they are only
part of a system of phenomena, and have been no more
connected with superstition than others less remarkable,
except in proportion to their remarkableness. Other minor
appearances that are at all unusual have, on the same
belief in the inextricable union of celestial and terrestrial
matters, been made the signs of calamities or extra-prosperity;
the doleful side of human nature being usually the
strongest, the former have been chosen more often than the
latter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Seneca, the tradition of the Chaldees
announced that a universal deluge would be caused by the
conjunction of all the planets in the sign of Capricorn, and
that a general breaking up of the earth would take place
at the moment of their conjunction in Cancer. "The general
break-up of the world," they said, "will happen when the
stars which govern the heaven, penetrated with a quality
of heat and dryness, meet one another in a fiery triplicity."</p>

<p>Everywhere, and in all ages of the past, men have
thought that a protecting providence, always watching over
them, has taken care to warn them of the destinies which
await them; thence the good and evil <i>presages</i> taken from
the appearance of certain heavenly bodies, of divers meteors,
or even the accidental meeting of certain animate or inanimate
objects. The Indian of North America dying of
famine in his miserable cabin, will not go out to the chase
if he sees certain presages in the atmosphere. Nor need we
be astonished at such ideas in an uncultivated man, when
even among Europeans, a salt-cellar upset, a glass broken,
a knife and fork crossed, the number thirteen at dinner, and
such things are regarded as unlucky accidents. The employment
of sorcery and divination is closely connected with
these superstitions. Besides eclipses and comets, meteors
were taken as the signs of divine wrath. We learn from
S. Maximus of Turin, that the Christians of his time
admitted the necessity of making a noise during eclipses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
so as to prevent the magicians from hurting the sun or
moon, a superstition entirely pagan. They used to fancy
they could see celestial armies in the air, coming to
bring miraculous assistance to man. They thought the
hurricanes and tempests the work of evil spirits, whose
rage kept them set against the earth. S. Thomas Aquinas,
the great theologian of the thirteenth century, accepted this
opinion, just as he admitted the reality of sorceries. But
the full development, as well as the nourishment of these
superstitious ideas, was derived from the storehouse of
astrology, which dealt with matters of ordinary occurrence,
both in the heavens and on the earth&mdash;and to the history
of which our next chapter is devoted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE GREATNESS AND THE FALL OF ASTROLOGY.</h3>


<p>Our study of the opinions of the ancients on the various
phenomena of astronomy, leads us inevitably to the discussion
of their astrology, which has in every age and among every
people accompanied it&mdash;and though astrology be now no
more as a science, or lingers only with those who are ignorant
and desirous of taking advantage of the still greater ignorance
of others&mdash;yet it is not lacking in interest as showing the
effect of the phenomena of the heavens on the human mind,
when that effect is brought to its most technical and complete
development.</p>

<p>We must distinguish in the first place two kinds of astrology,
viz., natural and judicial. The first proposed to foresee
and announce the changes of the seasons, the rains, wind,
heat, cold, abundance, or sterility of the ground, diseases, &amp;c.,
by means of a knowledge of the causes which act on the air
and on the atmosphere. The other is occupied with objects
which would be still more interesting to men. It traced at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
the moment of his birth, or at any other period of his life,
the line that each must travel according to his destiny. It
pretended to determine our characters, our passions, fortune,
misfortunes, and perils in reserve for each mortal.</p>

<p>We have not here to consider the natural astrology, which
is a veritable science of observation and does not deserve the
name of astrology. It is rather worthy to be called the
meteorological calendar of its cultivators. More rural than
their descendants of the nineteenth century, the ancients
had recognised the connection between the celestial phenomena
and the vicissitudes of the seasons; they observed
these phenomena carefully to discover the return of the
same inclemencies; and they were able (or thought they
were) to state the date of the return of particular kinds of
weather with the same positions of the stars. But the very
connection with the stars soon led the way to a degeneracy.
The autumnal constellations, for example, Orion and Hercules,
were regarded as rainy, because the rains came at the time
when these stars rose. The Egyptians who observed in the
morning, called Sirius "the burning," because his appearance
in the morning was followed by the great heat of the summer:
and it was the same with the other stars. Soon they regarded
them as the cause of the rain and the heat&mdash;although they
were but remote witnesses. The star Sirius is still connected
with heat&mdash;since we call it the dog-star&mdash;and the hottest days
of the year, July 22nd to August 23rd, we call dog-days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
At the commencement of our era, the morning rising of
Sirius took place on the earlier of those days&mdash;though it does
not now rise in the morning till the middle of August&mdash;and
4,000 years ago it rose about the 20th of June, and preceded
the annual rise of the Nile.</p>

<p>The belief in the meteorological influence of the stars is
one of the causes of judicial astrology. This latter has
simply subjected man, like the atmosphere, to the influence
of the stars; it has made dependent on them the risings of
his passions, the good and ill fortune of his life, as well as
the variations of the seasons. Indeed, it was very easy to
explain. It is the stars, or heavenly bodies in general, that
bring the winds, the rains, and the storms; their influences
mixed with the action of the rays of the sun modify the
cold or heat; the fertility of the fields, health or sickness,
depend on these beneficial or injurious influences; not a
blade of grass can grow without all the stars having contributed
to its increase; man breathes the emanations which
escaping from the heavenly bodies fill the air; man is
therefore in his entire nature subjected to them; these
stars must therefore influence his will and his passions;
the good and evil passages in his career, in a word, must
direct his life.</p>

<p>As soon as it was established that the rising of a certain
star or planet, and its aspect with regard to other planets,
announced a certain destiny to man, it was natural to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
believe that the rarer configurations signified extraordinary
events, which concerned great empires, nations, and towns.
And lastly, since errors grow faster than truth, it was natural
to think that the configurations which were still more rare,
such as the reunion of all the planets in conjunction with the
same star, which can occur only after thousands of centuries,
while nations have been renewed an infinity of times, and
empires have been ruined, had reference to the earth itself,
which had served as the theatre for all these events. Joined
to these superstitious ideas was the tradition of a deluge, and
the belief that the world must one day perish by fire, and
so it was announced that the former event took place when
all the planets were in conjunction in the sign of the Fishes,
and the latter would occur when they all met in the sign of
the Lion.</p>

<p>The origin of astrology, like that of the celestial sphere,
was in all probability in upper Asia.</p>

<p>There, the starry heavens, always pure and splendid, invited
observation and struck the imagination. We have already
seen this with respect to the more matter-of-fact portions
of astronomy. The Assyrians looked upon the stars as
divinities endued with beneficent or maleficent power. The
adoration of the heavenly bodies was the earliest form of
religion among the pastoral population that came down from
the mountains of Kurdestan to the plains of Babylon. The
Chald&aelig;ans at last set apart a sacerdotal and learned caste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
devoted to the observation of the heavens; and the temples
became regular observatories. Such doubtless was the tower
of Babel&mdash;a monument consecrated to the seven planets, and
of which the account has come down to us in the ancient
book of Genesis.</p>

<p>A long series of observations put the Chald&aelig;ans in possession
of a theological astronomy, resting on a more or less
chimerical theory of the influence of the celestial bodies on
the events of nations and private individuals. Diodorus
Siculus, writing towards the commencement of our era, has
put us in possession of the most circumstantial details that
have reached us with regard to the Chald&aelig;an priests.</p>

<p>At the head of the gods, the Assyrians placed the sun and
moon, whose courses and daily positions they had noted in
the constellation of the zodiac, in which the sun remained,
one month in each. The twelve signs were governed by as
many gods, who had the corresponding months under their
influence. Each of these months were divided into three
parts, which made altogether thirty-six subdivisions, over
which as many stars presided, called gods of consultation.
Half of these gods had under their control the things which
happen above the earth, and the other half those below. The
sun and moon and the five planets occupied the most elevated
rank in the divine hierarchy and bore the name of gods of
interpretation. Among these planets Saturn or old Bel,
which was regarded as the highest star and the most distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
from us, was surrounded by the greatest veneration; he was
the interpreter <i>par excellence</i>&mdash;the revealer. Each of the other
planets had his own particular name. Some of them, such
as <i>Bel</i> (Jupiter), <i>Merodaez</i> (Mars), <i>Nebo</i> (Mercury), were
regarded as male, and the others, as <i>Sin</i> (the Moon), and
<i>Mylitta</i> or <i>Baulthis</i> (Venus), as females; and from their
position relative to the zodiacal constellations, which were
also called <i>Lords</i> or masters of the <i>Gods</i>, the Chald&aelig;ans
derived the knowledge of the destiny of the men who were
born under such and such a conjunction&mdash;predictions which
the Greeks afterwards called horoscopes. The Chald&aelig;ans
invented also relations between each of the planets and
meteorological phenomena, an opinion partly founded on
fortuitous coincidences which they had more or less frequently
observed. In the time of Alexander their credit was considerable,
and the king of Macedonia, either from superstition
or policy, was in the habit of consulting them.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Babylonian priests, who referred
every natural property to sidereal influences, imagined there
were some mysterious relations between the planets and the
metals whose colours were respectively somewhat analogous
to theirs. Gold corresponded to the sun, silver to the moon,
lead to Saturn, iron to Mars, tin to Jupiter, and mercury
still retains the name of the planet with which it was
associated. It is less than two centuries ago, since the
metals have ceased to be designated by the signs of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
respective planets. Alchemy, the mother of chemistry, was
an intimately connected sister of Astrology, the mother of
Astronomy.</p>

<p>Egyptian civilisation dates back to a no less remote period
than that of Babylon. Not less careful observers than the
Babylonish astrologers of the meteors and the atmospheric
revolutions, they could predict certain phenomena, and they
gave it out that they had themselves been the cause of
them.</p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus tells us that the Egyptian priests pretty
generally predicted the years of barrenness or abundance, the
contagions, the earthquakes, inundations, and comets. The
knowledge of celestial phenomena made an essential part of
the theology of the Egyptians as it did of the Chald&aelig;ans.
They had colleges of priests specially attached to the study
of the stars, at which Pythagoras, Plato, and Eudoxus were
instructed.</p>

<p>Religion was besides completely filled with the symbols
relating to the sun or moon. Each month, each decade, each
day was consecrated to a particular god. These gods, to the
number of thirty, were called in the Alexandrine astronomy
<i>decans</i> (&#948;&#941;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;). The festivals were marked by the periodical
return of certain astronomical phenomena, and those heliacal
risings to which any mythological ideas were attached, were
noted with great care. We find even now proof of this old
sacerdotal science in the zodiac sculptured on the ceilings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
certain temples, and in the hieroglyphic inscriptions relating to
celestial phenomena.</p>

<p>According to the Egyptians, who were no less aware than
the Greeks, of the influence of atmospheric changes on our
organs, the different stars had a special action on each part of
the body. In the funeral rituals which were placed at the
bottom of the coffins, constant allusion is made to this
theory. Each limb of the dead body was placed under the
protection of a particular god. The divinities divided between
them, so to speak, the spoils of the dead. The head belonged
to Ra, or the Sun, the nose and lips to Anubis, and so on.
To establish the horoscope of anyone, this theory of specific
influences was combined with the state of the heavens at the
time of his birth. It seems even to have been the doctrine
of the Egyptians, that a particular star indicated the coming
of each man into the world, and this opinion was held also by
the Medes, and is alluded to in the Gospels. In Egypt, as in
Persia and Chald&aelig;a, the science of nature was a sacred
doctrine, of which magic and astrology constituted the two
branches, and in which the phenomena of the universe were
attached very firmly to the divinities or genii with which
they believed it filled. It was the same in the primitive
religions of Greece.</p>

<p>The Thessalian women had an especially great reputation
in the art of enchantments. All the poets rival one another
in declaring how they are able, by their magical hymns, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
bring down the moon. Menander, in his comedy entitled <i>The
Thessalian</i>, represents the mysterious ceremonies by the aid of
which these sorcerers force the moon to leave the heavens, a
prodigy which so completely became the type of enchantments
that Nonnus tells us it is done by the Brahmins. There was,
in addition, another <i>cultus</i> in Greece, namely, that of Hecate
with mysterious rays, the patron of sorcerers. Lucian of
Samosate&mdash;if the work on astrology which is ascribed to him
be really his&mdash;justifies his belief in the influence of the stars
in the following terms:&mdash;"The stars follow their orbit in the
heaven; but independently of their motion, they act upon
what passes here below. If you admit that a horse in a
gallop, that birds in flying, and men in walking, make the
stones jump or drive the little floating particles of dust by
the wind of their course, why should you deny that the stars
have any effect? The smallest fire sends us its emanations,
and although it is not for us that the stars burn, and they
care very little about warming us, why should we not receive
any emanations from them? Astrology, it is true, cannot
make that good which is evil. It can effect no change in
the course of events; but it renders a service to those who
cultivate it by announcing to them good things to come; it
procures joy by anticipation at the same time that it fortifies
them against the evil. Misfortune, in fact, does not take them
by surprise, the foreknowledge of it renders it easier and
lighter. That is my way of looking at astrology."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>Very different is the opinion of the satirist Juvenal, who
says that women are the chief cultivators of it. "All that
an astrologer predicts to them," he says, "they think to come
from the temple of Jupiter. Avoid meeting with a lady who
is always casting up her <i>ephemerides</i>, who is so good an
astrologer that she has ceased to consult, and is already
beginning to be consulted; such a one on the inspection of
the stars will refuse to accompany her husband to the army
or to his native land. If she only wishes to drive a mile, the
hour of departure is taken from her book of astrology. If
her eye itches and wants rubbing, she will do nothing till she
has run through her conjuring book. If she is ill in bed,
she will take her food only at the times fixed in her <i>Petosiris</i>.
Women of second-rate condition," he adds, "go round the
circus before consulting their destiny, after which they show
their hands and face to the diviner."</p>

<p>When Octavius came into the world a senator versed in
astrology, Nigidius Figulus, predicted the glorious destiny of
the future emperor. Livia, the wife of Tiberius, asked
another astrologer, Scribius, what would be the destiny of her
infant; his reply was, they say, like the other's.</p>

<p>The house of Poppea, the wife of Nero, was always full of
astrologers. It was one of the soothsayers attached to her
house, Ptolemy, who predicted to Otho his elevation to the
empire, at the time of the expedition into Spain, where he
accompanied him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of astrology under the Roman empire supplies
some very curious stories, of which we may select an illustrative
few.</p>

<p>Octavius, in company with Agrippa, consulted one day the
astrologer Theagenes.  The future husband of Julia, more
credulous or more curious than the nephew of C&aelig;sar, was the
first to take the horoscope. Theagenes foretold astonishing
prosperity for him. Octavius, jealous of so happy a destiny,
and fearing that the reply would be less favourable to him,
instead of following the example of his companion, refused
at first to state the day of his birth. But, curiosity getting
the better of him, he decided to reply. No sooner had he
told the day of his birth than the astrologer threw himself at
his feet, and worshipped him as the future master of the
empire. Octavius was transported with joy, and from that
moment was a firm believer in astrology. To commemorate
the happy influence of the zodiacal sign under which he
was born, he had the picture of it struck on some of the
medals that were issued in his reign.</p>

<p>The masters of the empire believed in astrological divination,
but wished to keep the advantages to themselves. They wanted
to know the future without allowing their subjects to do the
same. Nero would not permit anyone to study philosophy,
saying it was a vain and frivolous thing, from which one
might take a pretext to divine future events. He feared lest
some one should push his curiosity so far as to wish to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
out when and how the emperor should die&mdash;a sort of indiscreet
question, replies to which lead to conspiracies and attempts.
This was what the heads of the state were most
afraid of.</p>

<p>Tiberius had been to Rhodes, to a soothsayer of renown, to
instruct himself in the rules of astrology. He had attached
to his person the celebrated astrologer Thrasyllus, whose fate-revealing
science he proved by one of those pleasantries
which are only possible with tyrants.</p>

<p>Whenever Tiberius consulted an astrologer he placed
him in the highest part of his palace, and employed for
his purpose an ignorant and powerful freedman, who
brought by difficult paths, bounded by precipices, the
astrologer whose science his Majesty wished to prove. On
the return journey, if the astrologer was suspected of indiscretion
or treachery, the freedman threw him into the
sea, to bury the secret. Thrasyllus having been brought by
the same route across these precipices, struck Tiberius with
awe while he questioned him, by showing him his sovereign
power, and easily disclosing the things of the future.
C&aelig;sar asked him if he had taken his own horoscope, and
with what signs were marked that day and hour for
himself. Thrasyllus then examined the position and the
distance of the stars; he hesitated at first, then he grew
pale; then he looked again, and finally, trembling with
astonishment and fear, he cried out that the moment was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
perilous, and he was very near his last hour. Tiberius then
embraced him and congratulated him on having escaped
a danger by foreseeing it; and accepting henceforth all his
predictions as oracles, he admitted him to the number of
his intimate friends.</p>

<p>Tiberius had a great number of people put to death
who were accused of having taken their horoscope to know
what honours were in store for them, although in secret he
took the horoscopes of great people, that he might ascertain
that he had no rivalry to fear from them. Septimus
Severus was very nearly paying with his head for one of
those superstitious curiosities that brought the ambitious
of the time to the astrologer. In prosperous times he had
gained faith in their predictions, and consulted them about
important acts. Having lost his wife, and wishing to contract
a second marriage, he took the horoscopes of the well-connected
ladies who were at the time open to marriage.
None of their fortunes, taken by the rules of astrology, were
encouraging. He learnt at last that there was living in Syria
a young woman to whom the Chald&aelig;ans had predicted
that she should be the wife of a king. Severus was as
yet but a legate. He hastened to demand her in marriage,
and he obtained her; Julia was the name of the woman
who was born under so happy a star; but was he the
crowned husband which the stars had promised to the
young Syrian? This reflection soon began to perplex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Severus, and to get out of his perplexity he went to Sicily
to consult an astrologer of renown. The matter came to
the ears of the Emperor Commodus; and judge of his anger!
The anger of Commodus was rage and frenzy; but the
event soon gave the response that Severus was seeking
in Sicily,&mdash;Commodus was strangled.</p>

<p>Divination which had the emperor for its object at last
came to be a crime of high treason. The rigorous measures
resorted to against the indiscreet curiosity of ambition
took more terrible proportions under the Christian emperors.</p>

<p>Under Constantine, a number of persons who had applied
to the oracles were punished with cruel tortures.</p>

<p>Under Valens, a certain Palladius was the agent of a terrible
persecution. Everyone found himself exposed to being
denounced for having relations with soothsayers. Traitors
slipped secretly into houses magic formul&aelig; and charms,
which then became so many proofs against the inhabitant.
The fear was so great in the East, says Ammienus Marcellinus,
that a great number burned their books, lest matter should
be found in them for an accusation of magic or sorcery.</p>

<p>One day in anger, Vitellius commanded all the astrologers
to leave Italy by a certain day. They responded by a poster,
which impudently commanded the prince to leave the
earth before that date, and at the end of the year Vitellius
was put to death; on the other hand, the confidence accorded
to astrologers led sometimes to the greatest extremes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
For instance, after having consulted Babylus, Nero put
to death all those whose prophecies promised the elevation
of Heliogabalus. Another instance was that of Marcus
Aurelius and his wife Faustina. The latter was struck
with the beauty of a gladiator. For a long time she vainly
strove in secret with the passion that consumed her, but the
passion did nothing but increase. At last Faustina revealed
the matter to her husband, and asked him for some remedy
that should restore peace to her troubled soul. The philosophy
of Marcus Aurelius could not suggest anything.
So he decided to consult the Chald&aelig;ans, who were adepts
at the art of mixing philters and composing draughts.
The means prescribed were more simple than might have
been expected from their complicated science; it was that
the gladiator should be cut in pieces. They added that
Faustina should afterwards be anointed with the blood
of the victim. The remedy was applied, the innocent
athlete was immolated, and the empress afterwards only
dreamed of him with great pleasure.</p>

<p>The first Christians were as much addicted to astrology
as the other sects. The Councils of Laodicea (366, <small>A.D.</small>),
of Arles (314), of Agdus (505), Orleans (511), Auxerre
(570), and Narbonne (589), condemned the practice. According
to a tradition of the commencement of our era, which
appears to have been borrowed from Mazdeism, it was the
rebel angels who taught men astrology and the use of charms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>Under Constantius the crime of high treason served as
a pretext for persecution. A number of people were
accused of it, who simply continued to practise the ancient
religion. It was pretended that they had recourse to
sorceries against the life of the emperor, in order to bring
about his fall. Those who consulted the oracles were
menaced with severe penalties and put to death by torture,
under the pretence that by dealing with questions of fate
they had criminal intentions. Plots without number
multiplied the accusations; and the cruelty of the judges
aggravated the punishments. The pagans, in their turn
had to suffer the martyrdom which they had previously
inflicted on the early disciples of Christ&mdash;or rather, to
be truer, it was authority, always intolerable, whether pagan
or Christian, that showed itself inexorable against those
who dared to differ from the accepted faith. Libanius and
Jamblicus were accused of having attempted to discover the
name of the successor to the empire. Jamblicus, being
frightened at the prosecution brought against him, poisoned
himself. The name only of philosopher was sufficient to
found an accusation upon. The philosopher Maximus
Diogenes Alypius, and his son Hierocles, were condemned
to lose their lives on the most frivolous pretence. An old
man was put to death because he was in the habit of
driving off the approach of fever by incantations, and a
young man who was surprised in the act of putting his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
hands alternately to a marble and his breast, because he
thought that by counting in this way seven times seven, he
might cure the stomach-ache, met with the same fate.</p>

<p>Theodosius prohibited every kind of manifestation or usage
connected with pagan belief. Whoever should dare to immolate
a victim, said his law, or consult the entrails of the
animals he had killed, should be regarded as guilty of the
crime of high treason.</p>

<p>The fact of having recourse to a process of divination was
sufficient for an accusation against a man.</p>

<p>Theodosius II. thought that the continuation of idolatrous
practices had drawn down the wrath of heaven, and
brought upon them the recent calamities that had afflicted
his empire&mdash;the derangement of the seasons and the sterility
of the soil&mdash;and he thundered out terrible threats when his
faith and his anger united themselves into fanaticism.</p>

<p>He wrote as follows to Florentius, prefect of the pr&aelig;torium
in 439, the year that preceded his death:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are we to suffer any longer from the seasons being
upset by the effect of the divine wrath, on account of the
atrocious perfidy of the pagans, which disturbs the equilibrium
of nature? For what is the cause that now the
spring has no longer its ordinary beauty, that the autumn
no longer furnishes a harvest to the laborious workman
and that the winter, by its rigour, freezes the soil and
renders it sterile?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps we are unduly amused with these ideas of Theodosius
so long as we retain the custom of asking the special intervention
of Providence for the presence or absence of rain!</p>

<p>In the middle ages, when astrology took such a hold on the
world, several philosophers went so far as to consider the
celestial vault as a book, in which each star, having the value
of one of the letters of the alphabet, told in ineffaceable
characters the destiny of every empire. The book of <i>Unheard-of
Curiosities</i>, by Gaffarel, gives us the configuration of these
celestial characters, and we find them also in the writings of
Cornelius Agrippa. The middle ages took their astrological
ideas from the Arabians and Jews. The Jews themselves at
this epoch borrowed their principles from such contaminated
sources that we are not able to trace in them the transmission
of the ancient ideas. To give an example, Simeon Ben-Jochai,
to whom is attributed the famous book called <i>Zohar</i>, had
attained in their opinion such a prodigious acquaintance with
celestial mysteries as indicated by the stars, that he could
have read the divine law in the heavens before it had been
promulgated on the earth. During the whole of the middle
ages, whenever they wanted to clear up doubts about geography
or astronomy, they always had recourse to this
Oriental science, as cultivated by the Jews and Arabians.
In the thirteenth century Alphonse X. was very importunate
with the Jews to make them assist him with their advice in
his vast astronomical and historical works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>Nicholas Oresmus, when the most enlightened monarch in
Europe was supplying Du Guesclin with an astrologer to
guide him in his strategical operations, was physician to
Charles V. of France, who was himself devoted to astrology,
and gave him the bishopric of Lisieux. He composed the
<i>Treatise of the Sphere</i>, of which we have already spoken. A
few years later, a learned man, the bishop Peter d'Ailly,
actually dared to take the horoscope of Jesus Christ, and
proved by most certain rules that the great event which
inaugurated the new era was marked with very notable signs
in astrology.</p>

<p>Mathias Corvin, King of Hungary, never undertook anything
without first consulting the astrologers. The Duke of
Milan and Pope Paul also governed themselves by their
advice. King Louis XI., who so heartily despised the rest of
mankind, and had as much malice in him as he had weakness,
had a curious adventure with an astrologer.</p>

<p>It was told him that an astrologer had had the hardihood
to predict the death of a woman of whom the king was very
fond. He sent for the wretched prophet, gave him a severe
reprimand, and then asked him the question, "You, who
know everything, when will <i>you</i> die?" The astrologer, suspecting
a trick, replied immediately, "Sire, three days before
your Majesty." Fear and superstition overcame the monarch's
resentment, and the king took particular care of the adroit
impostor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known how much Catherine de Medicis was
under the influence of the astrologers. She had one in her
H&ocirc;tel de Soissons in Paris, who watched constantly at the
top of a tower. This tower is still in existence, by the
Wool-Market, which was built in 1763 on the site of the
hotel. It is surmounted by a sphere and a solar dial, placed
there by the astronomer Pingr&eacute;.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated of the astrologers who was
under her patronage was Nostradamus. He was a physician
of Provence, and was born at St. Reny in 1503. To medicine
he joined astrology, and undertook to predict future events.
He was called to Paris by Catherine in 1556, and attempted
to write his oracles in poetry. His little book was much
sought after during the whole of the remainder of the sixteenth
century, and even in the beginning of the next.
According to contemporary writers many imitations were
made of it. It was written in verses of four lines, and was
called <i>Quatrains Astronomiques</i>. As usual, the prophecies
were obscure enough to suit anything, and many believers have
thought they could trace in the various verses prophecies of
known events, by duly twisting and manipulating the sense.</p>

<p>A very amusing prophecy, which happened to be too clear
to leave room for mistakes as to its meaning, and which
turned out to be most ludicrously wrong, was one contained
in a little book published in 1572 with this title:&mdash;<i>Prognostication
touching the marriage of the very honourable and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
beloved Henry, by the Grace of God King of Navarre, and
the very illustrious Princess Marguerite of France, calculated
by Master Bernard Abbatio, Doctor in Medicine, and Astrologer
to the very Christian King of France.</i></p>

<p>First he asked if the marriage would be happy, and
says:&mdash;"Having in my library made the figure of the
heavens, I found that the lord of the ascendant is joined
to the lord of the seventh house, which is for the woman
of a trine aspect, from whence I have immediately concluded,
according to the opinion of Ptolemy, Haly, Zael, Messahala,
and many other sovereign astrologers, that they will love
one another intensely all their lives." In point of fact they
always detested each other. Again, "as to length of
life, I have prepared another figure, and have found that
Jupiter and Venus are joined to the sun with fortification,
and that they will approach a hundred years;" after all
Henri IV. died before he was sixty. "Our good King of
Navarre will have by his most noble and virtuous Queen
many children; since, after I had prepared another figure of
heaven, I found the ascendant and its lord, together with
the moon, all joined to the lord of the fifth house, called
that of children, which will be pretty numerous, on account
of Jupiter and also of Venus;" and yet they had no children!
"Jupiter and Venus are found domiciled on the aquatic
signs, and since these two planets are found concordant
with the lord of the ascendant, all this proves that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
children will be upright and good, and that they will love
their father and mother, without doing them any injury, nor
being the cause of their destruction, as is seen in the fruit
of the nut, which breaks, opens, and destroys the stock
from which it took its birth. The children will live long,
they will be good Christians, and with their father will
make themselves so benign and favourable towards those of
our religion, that at last they will be as beloved as any man
of our period, and there will be no more wars among the
French, as there would have been but for the present
marriage. God grant us grace that so long as we are in
this transitory life we may see no other king but
Charles IX., the present King of France." And yet these
words were written in the year of the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's day! and the marriage was broken off, and
Henri IV. married to Marie de Medici. So much for the
astrological predictions!</p>

<p>The aspect in which astrology was looked upon by the
better minds even when it was flourishing may be illustrated
by two quotations we may make, from Shakespeare and
Voltaire.</p>

<p>Our immortal poet puts into the mouth of Edmund in
<i>King Lear</i>:&mdash;"This is the excellent foppery of the world,
that when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeit of
our own behaviour) we make guilty of our disasters the
sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
treacherous, by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and
adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence;
and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An
admirable evasion of a libertine to lay his goatish disposition
to the charge of a star! My father married my mother
under the Dragon's tail; and my nativity was under <i>Ursa
major</i>; so that it follows I am rough lecherous. Tut, I
should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in
the firmament twinkled on my birth."</p>

<p>Voltaire writes thus:&mdash;"This error is ancient, and that is
enough. The Egyptians, the Chald&aelig;ans, the Jews could predict,
and therefore we can predict now. If no more predictions
are made it is not the fault of the art. So said the alchemists
of the philosopher's stone. If you do not find to-day
it is because you are not clever enough; but it is certain that
it is in the clavicle of Solomon, and on that certainty more
than two hundred families in Germany and France have
been ruined. Do you wonder either that so many men,
otherwise much exalted above the vulgar, such as princes
or popes, who knew their interests so well, should be so
ridiculously seduced by this impertinence of astrology.
They were very proud and very ignorant. There were no
stars but for them; the rest of the universe was <i>canaille</i>, for
whom the stars did not trouble themselves. I have not
the honour of being a prince. Nevertheless, the celebrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Count of Boulainvilliers and an Italian, called Colonne, who
had great reputation in Paris, both predicted to me that I
should infallibly die at the age of thirty-two. I have had
the malice already to deceive them by thirty years, for
which I humbly beg their pardon."</p>

<p>The method by which these predictions were arrived at
consisted in making the different stars and planets responsible
for different parts of the body, different properties, and
different events, and making up stories from the association
of ideas thus obtained, which of course admitted of the
greatest degree of latitude. The principles are explained by
Manilius in his great poem entitled <i>The Astronomicals</i>,
written two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>According to him the sun presided over the head, the
moon over the right arm, Venus over the left, Jupiter over
the stomach, Mars the parts below, Mercury over the right
leg, and Saturn over the left.</p>

<p>Among the constellations, the Ram governed the head; the
Bull the neck; the Twins the arms and shoulders; the Crab
the chest and the heart; the Lion the stomach; the abdomen
corresponded to the sign of the Virgin; the reins to the
Balance; then came the Scorpion; the Archer, governing the
thighs; the He-goat the knees; the Waterer the legs; and
the Fishes the feet.</p>

<p>Albert the Great assigned to the stars the following
influences:&mdash;Saturn was thought to rule over life, changes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
sciences, and buildings; Jupiter over honour, wishes, riches,
and cleanness; Mars over war, prisons, marriages, and
hatred; the sun over hope, happiness, gain, and heritages;
Venus over friendships and amours; Mercury over illness,
debts, commerce, and fear; the moon over wounds, dreams,
and larcenies.</p>

<p>Each of these stars also presides over particular days of
the week, particular colours, and particular metals.</p>

<p>The sun governed the Sunday; the moon, Monday;
Mars, Tuesday; Mercury, Wednesday; Jupiter, Thursday;
Venus, Friday; and Saturn, Saturday; which is partially
indicated by our own names of the week, but more particularly
in the French names, which are each and all derived
from these stars.</p>

<p>The sun represented yellow; the moon, white; Venus,
green; Mars, red; Jupiter, blue; Saturn, black; Mercury,
shaded colours.</p>

<p>We have already indicated the metals that corresponded
to each.</p>

<p>The sun was reckoned to be beneficent and favourable;
Saturn to be sad, morose, and cold; Jupiter, temperate and
benign; Mars, vehement; Venus, benevolent and fertile;
Mercury, inconstant; and the moon, melancholy.</p>

<p>Among the constellations, the Ram, the Lion, and the Archer
were hot, dry and vehement. The Bull, the Virgin, and the
He-goat were heavy, cold, and dry; the Twins, the Balance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
and the Waterer were light, hot, and moist; the Crab,
Scorpion, and the Fishes were moist, soft, and cold.</p>

<p>In this way the heavens were made to be intimately
connected with the affairs of earth; and astrology was in
equally intimate connection with astronomy, of which it
may in some sense be considered the mother. The drawers
of horoscopes were at one time as much in request as
lawyers or doctors.  One Thurneisen, a famous astrologer
and an extraordinary man, who lived last century at the
electoral court of Berlin, was at the same time physician,
chemist, drawer of horoscopes, almanack maker, printer, and
librarian. His astrological reputation was so widespread
that scarcely a birth took place in families of any rank in
Germany, Poland, Hungary, or even England without there
being sent an immediate envoy to him to announce the
precise moment of birth.  He received often three and
sometimes as many as ten messages a day, and he was at
last so pressed with business that he was obliged to take
associates and agents.</p>

<p>In the days of Kepler we know that astrology was more
thought of than astronomy, for though on behalf of the
world he worked at the latter, for his own daily bread he
was in the employ of the former, making almanacks and
drawing horoscopes that he might live.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>TIME AND THE CALENDAR.</h3>


<p>The opinions of thinkers on the nature of time have been
very varied. Some have considered time as an absolute
reality, which is exactly measured by hours, days, and years,
and is as known and real as any other object whose existence
is known to us. Others maintain that time is only a matter
of sensation, or that it is an illusion, or a hallucination
of a lively brain.</p>

<p>The definitions given of it by different great writers is
as various. Thus Kant calls it "one of the forms of
sensibility." Schelling declares it is "pure activity with
the negation of all being." Leibnitz defines it "the order
of successions" as he defined space to be the order of
co-existences. Newton and Clarke make space and time
two attributes of the Deity.</p>

<p>A study of the astronomical phenomena of the universe,
and a consideration of their teaching, give us authority for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
saying, that neither space nor time are realities, but that
the only things absolute are eternity and infinity.</p>

<p>In fact, we give the name of time to the succession of
the terrestrial events measured by the motion of the earth.
If the earth were not to move, we should have no means
of measuring, and consequently no idea of time as we
have it now. So long as it was believed that the earth was
at rest, and that the sun and all the stars turned round us,
this apparent motion was then, as the real motion of the
earth is now, the method of generating time. In fact, the
Fathers said that at the end of the world the diurnal
motion would cease, and there would be no more time.
But let us examine the fact a little further.</p>

<p>Suppose for an instant that the earth was, as it was
formerly believed to be, an immense flat surface, which was
illuminated by a sun which remained always immovable at
the zenith, or by an invariable diffused light&mdash;such an
earth being supposed to be alone by itself in the universe
and immovable. Now if there were a man created on that
earth, would there be such a thing as "time" for him?
The light which illumines him is immovable. No moving
shadow, no gnomon, no sun-dial would be possible. No day
nor night, no morning nor evening, no year. Nothing that
could be divided into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>

<p>In such a case one would have to fall back upon some
other terminating events, which would indicate a lapse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
time; such for instance as the life of a man. This, however,
would be no universal measure, for on one planet the life
might be a thousand years, and on another only a hundred.</p>

<p>Or we may look at it in another way. Suppose the
earth were to turn twice as fast about itself and about the
sun, the persons who lived sixty of such years would only
have lived thirty of our present years, but they would
have seen sixty revolutions of the earth, and, rigorously
speaking, would have lived sixty years. If the earth turned
ten times as fast, sixty years would be reduced to ten, but
they would still be sixty of those years. We should live
just as long; there would be four seasons, 365 days, &amp;c.,
only everything would be more rapid: but it would be
exactly the same thing for us, and the other apparently
celestial motions having a similar diminution, there would
be no change perceived by us.</p>

<p>Again, consider the minute animals that are observable
under the microscope, which live but for five minutes.
During that period, they have time to be born and to grow.
From embryos they become adult, marry, so to speak, and
have a numerous progeny, which they develop and send into
the world. Afterwards they die, and all this in a few
minutes. The impressions which, in spite of their minuteness,
we are justified in presuming them to possess, though
rapid and fleeting, may be as profound for them in proportion
as ours are to us, and their measure of time would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
be very different from ours. All is relative. In absolute
value, a life completed in a hundred years is not longer than
one that is finished in five minutes.</p>

<p>It is the same for space. The earth has a diameter of
8,000 miles, and we are five or six feet high. Now if, by
any process, the earth should diminish till it became as
small as a marble, and if the different elements of the world
underwent a corresponding diminution, our mountains might
become as small as grains of sand, the ocean might be
but a drop, and we ourselves might be smaller than the
microscopic animals adverted to above. But for all that
nothing would have changed for us. We should still be our
five or six feet high, and the earth would remain exactly
the same number of our miles.</p>

<p>A value then that can be decreased and diminished at
pleasure without change is not a mathematical absolute
value. In this sense then it may be said that neither time
nor space have any real existence.</p>

<p>Or once again. Suppose that instead of our being on
the globe, we were placed in pure space. What time should
we find there? No time. We might remain ten years,
twenty, a hundred, or a thousand years, but we should never
arrive at the next year! In fact each planet makes its own
time for its inhabitants, and where there is no planet or
anything answering to it there is no time. Jupiter makes
for its inhabitants a year which is equal to twelve years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of ours, and a day of ten of our hours. Saturn has a year
equal to thirty of ours, and days of ten hours and a quarter.
In other solar systems there are two or three suns, so that
it is difficult to imagine what sort of time they can have.
All this infinite diversity of time takes place in eternity,
the only thing that is real. The whole history of the earth
and its inhabitants takes place, not in time, but in eternity.
Before the existence of the earth and our solar system, there
was another time, measured by other motions, and having
relation to other beings. When the earth shall exist no
longer, there may be in the place we now occupy, another
time again, for other beings. But they are not realities. A
hundred millions of centuries, and a second, have the same
real length in eternity. In the middle of space, we could
not tell the difference. Our finite minds are not capable of
grasping the infinite, and it is well to know that our only
idea of time is relative, having relation to the regular events
that befall this planet in its course, and not a thing which
we can in any way compare with that, which is so alarming
to the ideas of some&mdash;eternity.</p>

<p>We have then to deal with the particular form of time
that our planet makes for us, for our personal use.</p>

<p>It turns about the sun. An entire circuit forms a
period, which we can use for a measure in our terrestrial
affairs. We call it a year, or in Latin <i>annus</i>, signifying a
circle, whence our word <i>annual</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>A second, shorter revolution, turns the earth upon itself, and
brings each meridian directly facing the sun, and then round
again to the opposite side. This period we call a <i>day</i>, from
the Latin <i>dies</i>, which in Italian becomes <i>giorne</i>, whence the
French <i>jour</i>. In Sanscrit we have the same word in <i>dyaus</i>.</p>

<p>The length of time that it takes for the earth to arrive at
the same position with respect to the stars, which is called
a sidereal year, amounts to 365&middot;2563744 days. But during
this time, as we have seen, the equinox is displaced among
the stars. This secular retrogression brings it each year a
little to the east of its former position, so that the sun
arrives there about eleven minutes too soon. By taking
this amount from the sidereal we obtain the tropical year,
which has reference to the seasons and the calendar. Its
length is 365&middot;2422166 days, or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes,
47&middot;8 seconds.</p>

<p>In what way was the primitive year regulated? was it
a solar or a sidereal year?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that when there was an absence
of all civilisation and a calendar of any sort was unknown,
the year meant simply the succession of seasons, and that
no attempt would be made to reckon any day as its
commencement. And as soon as this was attempted a
difficulty would arise from there not being an exact number
of days in the year. So that when reckoned as the interval
between certain positions of the sun they would be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
different lengths, which would introduce some difficulty as to
the commencement of the year. Be this the case, however,
or not, Mr. Haliburton's researches seem to show that the
earliest form of year was the sidereal one, and that it was
regulated by the Pleiades.</p>

<p>In speaking of that constellation we have noticed that
among the islanders of the southern hemisphere and others
there are two years in one of ours, the first being called the
Pleiades above and the second the Pleiades below; and we
have seen how the same new year's day has been recognised
in very many parts of the world and among the ancient
Egyptians and Hindoos. This year would begin in November,
and from the intimate relation of all the primitive calendars
that have been discovered to a particular day, taken as
November 17 by the Egyptians, it would appear probable that
for a long time corrections were made both by the Egyptians
and others in order to keep the phenomenon of the Pleiades
just rising at sunset to one particular named day of their year&mdash;showing
that the year they used was a sidereal one. This
can be traced back as far as 1355 <small>B.C.</small> among the Egyptians,
and to 1306 <small>B.C.</small> among the Hindoos. There seem to have
been in use also shorter periods of three months, which, like
the two-season year, appear to have been, as they are now
among the Japanese, regulated by the different positions of
the Pleiades.</p>

<p>Among the Siamese of the present day, there are both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
forms of the year existing, one sidereal, beginning in
November, and regulated by the fore-named constellation;
and the other tropical, beginning in April. Whether, however,
the year be reckoned by the stars or by the sun, there
will always be a difficulty in arranging the length of the
year, because in each case there will be about a quarter of a
day over.</p>

<p>It seems, too, to have been found more convenient in early
times to take 360 days as the length of the year, and to
add an intercalary month now and then, rather than 365
and add a day.</p>

<p>Thus among the earliest Egyptians the year was of 360
days, which were reckoned in the months, and five days
were added each year, between the commencement of one
and the end of the other, and called unlucky days. It was
the belief of the Egyptians that these five days were the
birthdays of their principal gods; Osiris being born on the
first, Anieris (or Apollo) on the second, Typhon on the third,
Isis on the fourth, Nephys (or Aphrodite) on the fifth. These
appear to have some relation with similar unlucky days
among the Greeks and Romans, and other nations.</p>

<p>The 360 days of the Egyptian year were represented at
Acantho, near Memphis, in a symbolical way, there being
placed a perforated vessel, which each day was filled with
water by one of a company of 360 priests, each priest having
charge over one day in the year. A similar symbolism was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
used at the tomb of Osiris, around which were placed 360
pitchers, one of which each day was filled with milk.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the 365 days were represented by the
tomb of Osymandyas, at Thebes, being surrounded by a circle
of gold which was one cubit broad and 365 cubits in circumference.
On the side were written the risings and
settings of the stars, with the prognostications derived from
them by the Egyptian astrologers. It was destroyed, however,
by Cambyses when the Persians conquered Egypt.</p>

<p>They divided their year according to Herodotus into
twelve months, the names of which have come down to us.</p>

<p>Even with the 365 days, which their method of reckoning
would practically come to, they would still be a quarter of
a day each year short; so that in four years it would amount
to a whole day, an error which would amount to something
perceptible even during the life of a single man, by
its bringing the commencement of the civil year out of
harmony with the seasons. In fact the first day of the year
would gradually go through all the seasons, and at the end
of 1460 solar years there would have been completed 1461
civil years, which would bring back the day to its original
position. This period represents a cycle of years in which
approximately the sun and the earth come to the same
relative position again, as regards the earth's rotation on its
axis and revolution round the sun. This cycle was noticed
by Firmicius. Another more accurate cycle of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
kind, noticed by Syncellus, is obtained by multiplying 1461
by 25, making 36,525 years, which takes into account the
defect which the extra hours over 365 have from six. The
Egyptians, however, did not allow their year to get into so
large an error, though it was in error by their using sidereal
time, regulating their year, and intercalating days, first
according to the risings of the Pleiades, and after according
to that of Sirius, the dog-star, which announced to them
the approaching overflowing of the Nile, a phenomenon of
such great value to Egypt that they celebrated it with annual
f&ecirc;tes of the greatest magnificence.</p>

<p>Among the Babylonians, as we are informed by Mr. Sayce,
the year was divided into twelve lunar months and 360 days,
an intercalary month being added whenever a certain star,
called the "star of stars," or Icu, also called Dilgan, by the
ancient Accadians, meaning the "messenger of light," and
what is now called Aldebaran, which was just in advance of
the sun when it crossed the vernal equinox, was not parallel
with the moon until the third of Nisan, that is, two days
after the equinox. They also added shorter months of a
few days each when this system became insufficient to keep
their calendar correct.</p>

<p>They divided their year into four quarters of three months
each; the spring quarter not commencing with the beginning
of the year when the sun entered the spring equinox, proving
that the arrangement of seasons was subsequent to the settling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
of the calendar. The names of their months were given them
from the corresponding signs of the zodiac; which was the
same as our own, though the zodiac began with Aries and the
year with Nisan.</p>

<p>They too had cycles, but they arose from a very different
cause; not from errors of reckoning in the civil year or the
revolution of the earth, but from the variations of the weather.
Every twelve solar years they expected to have the same
weather repeated. When we connect this with their observations
on the varying brightness of the sun, especially at the
commencement of the year on the first of Nisan, which they
record at one time as "bright yellow" and at another as
"spotted," and remember that modern researches have shown
that weather is certainly in some way dependent on the
solar spots, which have a period <i>now</i> of about eleven years,
we cannot help fancying that they were very near to
making these discoveries.</p>

<p>The year of the ancient Persians consisted of 365 days.
The extra quarter of a day was not noticed for 120 years,
at the end of which they intercalated a month&mdash;in the first
instance, at the end of the first month, which was thus
doubled. At the end of another 120 years they inserted an
intercalary month after the second month, and so on through
all their twelve months. So that after 1440 years the series
began again. This period they called the intercalary cycle.</p>

<p>The calendar among the Greeks was more involved, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
more useful. It was <i>luni-solar</i>, that is to say, they regulated
it at the same time by the revolutions of the moon and the
motion about the sun, in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>The year commenced with the new moon nearest to the
20th or 21st of June, the time of the summer solstice; it
was composed in general of twelve months, each of which
commenced on the day of the new moon, and which had
alternately twenty-nine and thirty days.</p>

<p>This arrangement, conformable to the lunar year, only gave
354 days to the civil year, and as this was too short by ten
days, twenty-one hours, this difference, by accumulation,
produced nearly eighty-seven days at the end of eight years,
or three months of twenty-nine days each. To bring the
lunar years into accordance with the solstices, it was necessary
to add three intercalary months every eight years.</p>

<p>The phases of the moon being thus brought into comparison
with the rotation of the earth, a cycle was discovered
by Meton, now known as the Metonic cycle, useful also in
predicting eclipses, which comprised nineteen years, during
which time 235 lunations will have very nearly occurred, and
the full moons will return to the same dates. In fact,
the year and the lunation are to one another very nearly in
the proportion of 235 to 19. By observing for nineteen
years the positions and phases of the moon, they will be
found to return again in the same order at the same times,
and they can therefore be predicted. This lunar cycle was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
adopted in the year 433 <small>B.C.</small> to regulate the luni-solar
calendar, and it was engraved in letters of gold on the walls
of the temple of Minerva, from whence comes the name
<i>golden number</i>, which is given to the number that marks
the place of the given year in this period of nineteen.</p>

<p>Caliphus made a larger and more exact cycle by multiplying
by four and taking away one day. Thus he made
of 27,759 days 76 Julian years, during which there were
940 lunations.</p>

<p>The Roman calendar was even more complicated than the
Greek, and not so good. Romulus is said to have given to his
subjects a strange arrangement that we can no longer understand.
More of a warrior than a philosopher, this founder
of Rome made the year to consist of ten months, some being
of twenty days and others of fifty-five. These unequal
lengths were probably regulated by the agricultural works
to be done, and by the prevailing religious ideas. After the
conclusion of these days they began counting again in the
same order; so that the year had only 304 days.</p>

<p>The first of these ten months was called <i>Mars</i> after the
name of the god from whom Romulus pretended to have
descended. The name of the second, Aprilis, was derived
from the word <i>aperire</i>, to open, because it was at the time
that the earth opened; or it may be, from Aphrodite, one of
the names of Venus, the supposed grandmother of &AElig;neas.
The third month was consecrated to <i>Ma&iuml;a</i>, the mother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Mercury. The names of the six others expressed simply
their order&mdash;Quintilis, the fifth; Sextilis, the sixth; September,
the seventh; and so on.</p>

<p>Numa added two months to the ten of Romulus; one took
the name of <i>Januarius</i>, from <i>Janus</i>: the name of the other
was derived either from the sacrifices (<i>februalia</i>), by which
the faults committed during the course of the past year were
expiated, or from <i>Februo</i>, the god of the dead, to which the
last month was consecrated. The year then had 355 days.</p>

<p>These Roman months have become our own, and hence a
special interest attaches to the consideration of their origin,
and the explanation of the manner in which they have been
modified and supplemented. Each of them was divided into
unequal parts, by the days which were known as the calends,
nones, and ides. The calends were invariably fixed to the
first day of each month; the nones came on the 5th or 7th,
and the ides the 13th or 15th.</p>

<p>The Romans, looking forward, as children do to festive
days, to the f&ecirc;te which came on these particular days, named
each day by its distance from the next that was following.
Immediately after the calends of a month, the dates were
referred to the nones, each day being called seven, six, five,
and so on days before the nones; on the morrow of the
nones they counted to the ides; and so the days at the
end of the month always bore the name of the calends of
the month following.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>To complete the confusion the 2nd day before the f&ecirc;te
was called the 3rd, by counting the f&ecirc;te itself as the 1st, and
so they added one throughout to the number that <i>we</i> should
now say expressed our distance from a certain date.</p>

<p>Since there were thus ten days short in each year, it was
soon found necessary to add them on, so a supplementary
month was created, which was called Mercedonius. This
month, by another anomaly, was placed between the 23rd
and 24th of February. Thus, after February 23rd, came
1st, 2nd, 3rd of Mercedonius; and then after the dates of
this supplementary month were gone through, the original
month was taken up again, and they went on with the 24th
of February.</p>

<p>And finally, to complete the medley, the priests who had
the charge of regulating this complex calendar, acquitted
themselves as badly as they could; by negligence or an
arbitrary use of their power they lengthened or shortened
the year without any uniform rule. Often, indeed, they
consulted in this nothing but their own convenience, or the
interests of their friends.</p>

<p>The disorder which this license had introduced into the
calendar proceeded so far that the months had changed from
the seasons, those of winter being advanced to the autumn,
those of the autumn to the summer. The f&ecirc;tes were celebrated
in seasons different from those in which they were
instituted, so that of Ceres happened when the wheat was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
in the blade, and that of Bacchus when the raisins were
green. Julius C&aelig;sar, therefore, determined to establish a
solar year according to the known period of revolution of
the sun, that is 365 days and a quarter. He ordained that
each fourth year a day should be intercalated in the place
where the month Mercedonius used to be inserted, <i>i.e.</i>
between the 23rd and 24th of February.</p>

<p>The 6th of the calends of March in ordinary years was
the 24th of February; it was called <i>sexto-kalendas</i>. When an
extra day was put in every fourth year before the 24th, this
was a second 6th day, and was therefore called <i>bissexto-kalendas</i>,
whence we get the name bissextile, applied to leap year.</p>

<p>But it was necessary also to bring back the public f&ecirc;tes
to the seasons they ought to be held in: for this purpose
C&aelig;sar was obliged to insert in the current year, 46 <small>B.C.</small> (or
708 <small>A.U.C.</small>), two intercalary months beside the month Mercedonius.
There was, therefore, a year of fifteen months divided
into 445 days, and this was called the year of confusion.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar gave the strictest injunctions to Sosigenes, a celebrated
Alexandrian astronomer whom he brought to Rome
for this purpose; and on the same principles Flavius was
ordered to compose a new calendar, in which all the Roman
f&ecirc;tes were entered&mdash;following, however, the old method of
reckoning the days from the calends, nones, and ides.
Antonius, after the death of C&aelig;sar, changed the name of
Quintilis, in which Julius C&aelig;sar was born, into the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
<i>Julius</i>, whence we derive our name July. The name of
<i>Augustus</i> was given to the month <i>Sextilis</i>, because the Emperor
Augustus obtained his greatest victories during that month.</p>

<p>Tiberius, Nero, and other imperial monsters attempted
to give their names to the other months. But the people
had too much independence and sense of justice to accord
them such a flattery.</p>

<p>The remaining months we have as they were named in
the days of Numa Pompilius.</p>

<p>A cubical block of white marble has been found at
Pompeii which illustrates this very well.</p>

<p>Each of the four sides is divided into three columns, and
on each column is the information about the month. Each
month is surmounted by the sign of the zodiac through
which the sun is passing. Beneath the name of the month
is inscribed the number of days it contains; the date
of the nones, the number of the hours of the day, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the night; the place of the sun, the divinity under whose
protection the month is placed, the agricultural works that
are to be done in it, the civil and ecclesiastical ceremonies
that are to be performed.  These inscriptions are to be seen
under the month January to the left of the woodcut.</p>

<p>The reform thus introduced by Julius C&aelig;sar is commonly
known as the <i>Julian reform</i>. The first year in which this
calendar was followed was 44 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The Julian calendar was in use, without any modification,
for a great number of years; nevertheless, the mean value
which had been assigned to the civil year being a little
different to that of the tropical, a noticeable change at length
resulted in the dates in which, each year, the seasons commenced;
so that if no remedy had been introduced, the
same season would be displaced little by little each year,
so as to commence successively in different months.</p>

<p>The Council of Nice, which was held in the year 325 of
the Christian era, adopted a fixed rule to determine the
time at which Easter falls. This rule was based on the
supposed fact that the spring equinox happened every year
on the 21st of March, as it did at the time of the meeting
of the Council. This would indeed be the case if the mean
value of the civil year of the Julian calendar was exactly
equal to the tropical year. But while the first is 365&middot;25
days, the second is 365&middot;242264 days; so that the tropical
year is too small by 11 minutes and 8 seconds. It follows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
hence that after the lapse of four Julian years the vernal
equinox, instead of happening exactly at the same time
as it did four years before, will happen 44 minutes 32
seconds too soon; and will gain as much in each succeeding
four years. So that at the end of a certain number of
years, after the year 325, the equinox will happen on the
20th of March, afterwards on the 19th, and so on. This continual
advance notified by the astronomers, determined Pope
Gregory XIII. to introduce a new reform into the calendar.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1582 that the <i>Gregorian reform</i> was
put into operation. At that epoch the vernal equinox
happened on the 11th instead of the 21st of March. To get
rid of this advance of ten days that the equinox had made
and to bring it back to the original date, Pope Gregory
decided that the day after the 4th of October, 1582, should
be called the 15th instead of the 5th. This change only did
away with the inconvenience at the time attaching to the
Julian calendar; it was necessary to make also some modification
in the rule which served to determine the lengths of
the civil years, in order to avoid the same error for the future.</p>

<p>So the Pope determined that in each 400 years there
should be only 97 bissextile years, instead of 100, as there
used to be in the Julian calendar. This made three days
taken off the 400 years, and in consequence the mean value of
the civil year is reduced to 365&middot;2425 days, which is not far
from the true tropical year. The Gregorian year thus obtained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
is still too great by &middot;000226 of a day; the date of the vernal
equinox will still then advance in virtue of this excess, but
it is easy to see that the Gregorian reform will suffice for a
great number of centuries.</p>

<p>The method in which it is carried out is as follows:&mdash;In
the Julian calendar each year that divided by four when
expressed in its usual way, by <small>A.D.</small>, was a leap year, and
therefore each year that completed a century was such,
as 1300, 1400 and so on&mdash;but in the Gregorian reform, all
these century numbers are to be reckoned common years, unless
the number without the two cyphers divides by four; thus
1,900 will be a common year and 2,000 a leap year. It is
easy to see that this will leave out three leap years in
every 400 years.</p>

<p>The Gregorian calendar was immediately adopted in France
and Germany, and a little later in England. Now it is in
operation in all the Christian countries of Europe, except
Russia, where the Julian calendar is still followed. It
follows that Russian dates do not agree with ours. In 1582,
the difference was ten days, and this difference remained
the same till the end of the seventeenth century, when the
year 1700 was bissextile in the Julian, but not in the
Gregorian calendar, so the difference increased to eleven
days, and now in the same way is twelve days.</p>

<p>Next to the year, comes the day as the most natural
division of time in connection with the earth, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
it admits of less difference in its arrangements, as we
cannot be mistaken as to its length. It is the natural
standard too of our division of time into shorter intervals
such as hours, minutes, and seconds. By the word <i>day</i> we
mean of course the interval during which the earth makes
a complete revolution round itself, while <i>daytime</i> may be
used to express the portion of it during which our portion
of the earth is towards the sun. The Greeks to avoid
ambiguity used the word <i>nyctemere</i>, meaning night and day.</p>

<p>No ancient nation is known that did not divide the
day into twenty-four hours, when they divided it at all into
such small parts, which seems to show that such a division
was comparatively a late institution, and was derived from
the invention of a single nation. It would necessarily
depend on the possibility of reckoning shorter periods of
time than the natural one of the day. In the earliest
ages, and even afterwards, the position of the sun in the
heavens by day, and the position of the constellations
by night, gave approximately the time. Instead of asking
What "o'clock" is it? the Greeks would say, "What star is
passing?" The next method of determining time depended
on the uniform motion of water from a cistern. It was
invented by the Egyptians, and was called a clepsydra,
and was in use among the Babylonians, the Greeks, and
the Romans. The more accurate measurement of time by
means of clocks was not introduced till about 140 <small>B.C.</small>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
when Trimalcion had one in his dining chamber. The
use of them, however, had been so lost that in 760 <small>A.D.</small>
they were considered quite novelties. The clocks, of course,
have to be regulated by the sun, an operation which has
been the employment of astronomers, among other things,
for centuries. Each locality had its own time according
to the moment when the sun passed the meridian of the
place, a moment which was determined by observation.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the hour, the day and night
appear to have been divided into watches. Among the
Babylonians the night was reckoned from what we call
6 <small>A.M.</small> to 6 <small>P.M.</small>, and divided into three watches of four
hours each&mdash;called the "evening," "middle," and "morning"
watch. These were later superseded by the more
accurate hour, or rather "double hour" or <i>casbri</i>, each of
which was divided into sixty minutes and sixty seconds,
and the change taking place not earlier than 2,000 <small>B.C.</small>
Whether the Babylonians (or Accadians) were the inventors
of the hour it is difficult to say, though they almost
certainly were of other divisions of time. It is remarkable
that in the ancient Jewish Scriptures we find no
mention of any such division until the date at which
the prophecy of Daniel was written, that is, until the Jews
had come in contact with the Babylonians.</p>

<p>Some nations have counted the twenty-four hours consecutively
from one to twenty-four as astronomers do now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
but others and the majority have divided the whole period
into two of twelve hours each.</p>

<p>The time of the commencement of the day has varied
much with the different nations.</p>

<p>The Jews, the ancient Athenians, the Chinese, and
several other peoples, more or less of the past, have commenced
the day with the setting of the sun, a custom which
perhaps originated with the determination of the commencement
of the year, and therefore of the day, by the observation
of some stars that were seen at sunset, a custom continued
in our memory by the well-known words, "the evening and
the morning were the first day."</p>

<p>The Italians, till recently, counted the hours in a single
series, between two settings of the sun. The only gain in
such a method would be to sailors, that they might know
how many hours they had before night overtook them; the
sun always setting at twenty-four o'clock; if the watch
marked nineteen or twenty, it would mean they had five or
four hours to see by&mdash;but such a gain would be very small
against the necessity of setting their watches differently
every morning, and the inconvenience of never having
fixed hours for meals.</p>

<p>Among the Babylonians, Syrians, Persians, the modern
Greeks, and inhabitants of the Balearic Isles, &amp;c., the day
commenced with the rising of the sun. Nevertheless, among
all the astronomical phenomena that may be submitted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
observation, none is so liable to uncertainty as the rising
and setting of the heavenly bodies, owing among other
things to the effects of refraction.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Arabians, followed in this by the
author of the <i>Almagesta</i>, and by Ptolemy, the day commenced
at noon. Modern astronomers adopt this usage. The
moment of changing the date is then always marked by a
phenomenon easy to observe.</p>

<p>Lastly, that we may see how every variety possible is sure
to be chosen when anything is left to the free choice of men,
we know that with the Egyptians, Hipparchus, the ancient
Romans, and all the European nations at present, the day
begins at midnight. Copernicus among the astronomers of
our era followed this usage. We may remark that the commencement
of the astronomical day commences twelve hours
<i>after</i> the civil day.</p>

<p>Of the various periods composed of several days, the week
of seven days is the most widely spread&mdash;and of considerable
antiquity. Yet it is not the universal method of
dividing months. Among the Egyptians the month was
divided into periods of ten days each; and we find no sign of
the seven days&mdash;the several days of the whole month having
a god assigned to each. Among the Hindoos no trace has
been found by Max M&uuml;ller in their ancient Vedic literature
of any such division, but the month is divided into two
according to the moon; the <i>clear</i> half from the new to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
the full moon, the <i>obscure</i> half from the full to the
new, and a similar division has been found among the
Aztecs. The Chinese divide the month like the Egyptians.
Among the Babylonians two methods of dividing the month
existed, and both of them from the earliest times. The first
method was to separate it into two halves of fifteen days
each, and each of these periods into three shorter ones of
five days, making six per month. The other method is the
week of seven days. The days of the week with them, as
they are with many nations now, were named after the sun
and moon and the five planets, and the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st,
and 28th days of each month&mdash;days separated by seven
days each omitting the 19th&mdash;were termed "days of rest," on
which certain works were forbidden to be done. From this
it is plain that we have here all the elements of our modern
week. We find it, as is well known, in the earliest of
Hebrew writings, but without the mark which gives reason
for the number seven, that is the names of the seven
heavenly bodies. It would seem most probable, then, that
we must look to the Accadians as the originators of our
modern week, from whom the Hebrews may have&mdash;and, if
so, at a very early period&mdash;borrowed the idea.</p>

<p>It is known that the week was not employed in the ancient
calendars of the Romans, into which it was afterwards introduced
through the medium of the biblical traditions, and
became a legal usage under the first Christian Emperors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
From thence it has been propagated together with the Julian
calendar amongst all the populations that have been subjected
to the Roman power. We find the period of seven days
employed in the astronomical treatises of Hindoo writers, but
not before the fifth century.</p>

<p>Dion Cassius, in the third century, represents the week as
universally spread in his times, and considers it a recent
invention which he attributes to the Egyptians; meaning
thereby, doubtless, the astrologers of the Alexandrian school,
at that time very eager to spread the abstract speculations of
Plato and Pythagoras.</p>

<p>If the names of the days of the week were derived from
the planets, the sun and moon, as is easy to see, it is not so
clear how they came to have their present order. The original
order in which they were supposed to be placed in the various
heavens that supported them according to their distance from
the earth was thus:&mdash;Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus,
Mercury, the Moon. One supposition is that each hour of
the day was sacred to one of these, and that each day was
named from the god that presided over the first hours. Now,
as seven goes three times into twenty-four, and leaves
three over, it is plain that if Saturn began the first
hour of Saturday, the next day would begin with the planet
three further on in the series, which would bring us to the
Sun for Sunday, three more would bring us next day to the
Moon for Monday, and so to Mars for Tuesday, to Mercury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
for Wednesday, to Jupiter for Thursday, to Venus for Friday,
and so round again to Saturn for Saturday.</p>

<p>The same method is illustrated by putting the symbols in
order round the circumference of a circle, and joining them
by lines to the one most opposite, following always in the
same order as in the following figure. We arrive in this way
at the order of the days of the week.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 58.</span>
</div>

<p>All the nations who have adopted the week have not kept
to the same names for them, but have varied them according
to taste. Thus Sunday was changed by the Christian Church
to the "Lord's Day," a name it still partially retains among
ourselves, but which is the regular name among several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
continental nations, including the corrupted <i>Dimanche</i> of
the French. The four middle days have also been very
largely changed, as they have been among ourselves and most
northern nations to commemorate the names of the great
Scandinavian gods Tuesco, Woden, Thor, and Friga. This
change was no doubt due to the old mythology of the
Druids being amalgamated with the new method of collecting
the days into weeks.</p>

<p>We give below a general table of the names of the days
of the week in several different languages.</p>

<p>The cycle which must be completed with the present
calendar to bring the same day of the year to the same
day of the week, is twenty-eight years, since there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
one day over every ordinary year, and two every leap
year; which will make an overlapping of days which,
except at the centuries, will go through all the changes
in twenty-eight times, which forms what is called the
solar cycle.</p>

<p>There is but one more point that will be interesting about
the calendar, namely, the date from which we reckon our
years.</p>

<p>Among the Jews it was from the creation of the world,
as recorded in their sacred books&mdash;but no one can determine
when that was with sufficient accuracy to make it represent
anything but an agreement of the present day. Different interpreters
do not come within a thousand years of one another
for its supposed date; although some of them have determined
it very accurately to their own satisfaction&mdash;one going so
far as to say that creation finished at nine o'clock one Sunday
morning! In other cases the date has been reckoned from
national events&mdash;as in the Olympiads, the foundation of
Rome, &amp;c. The word we now use, <small>&AElig;RA</small>, points to a particular
date from which to reckon, since it is composed of the
initials of the words AB EXORDIO REGNI AUGUSTI
"from the commencement of the reign of Augustus." At the
present day the point of departure, both forwards and backwards,
is the year of the birth of Jesus Christ&mdash;a date which
is itself controverted, and the use of which did not exist
among the first Christians. They exhibited great indifference,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
for many centuries, as to the year in which Jesus Christ
entered the world. It was a monk who lived in obscurity
at Rome, about the year 580, who was a native of so
unknown a country that he has been called a Scythian, and
whose name was Denys, surnamed <i>Exiguus</i>, or the Little,
who first attempted to discover by chronological calculations
the year of the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The era of Denys the Little was not adopted by his
contemporaries. Two centuries afterwards, the Venerable
Bede exhorted Christians to make use of it&mdash;and it only
came into general use about the year 800.</p>

<p>Among those who adopted the Christian era, some made
the year commence with March, which was the first month
of the year of Romulus; others in January, which commences
the year of Numa; others commenced on Christmas
Day; and others on Lady Day, March 25. Another form of
nominal year was that which commenced with Easter Day,
in which case, the festival being a movable one, some years
were shorter than others, and in some years there might
be two 2nd, 3rd, &amp;c., of April, if Easter fell in one year on
the 2nd, and next year a few days later.</p>

<p>The 1st of January was made to begin the year in
Germany in 1500. An edict of Charles IX. prescribes the
same in France in 1563. But it was not till 1752 that the
change was made in England by Lord Chesterfield's Act.
The year 1751, as the year that had preceded it, began on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
March 25th, and it should have lasted till the next Lady
Day; but according to the Act, the months of January,
February, and part of March were to be reckoned as part
of the year 1752. By this means the unthinking seemed
to have grown old suddenly by three months, and popular
clamour was raised against the promoter of the Bill, and
cries raised of "Give us our three months." Such have
been the various changes that our calendar has undergone
to bring it to its present state.</p>

<h3>THE END OF THE WORLD.</h3>


<p>Perhaps the most anxious question that has been asked of
the astronomer is when the world is to come to an end. It is
a question which, of course, he has no power to answer with
truth; but it is also one that has often been answered in good
faith. It has perhaps been somewhat natural to ask such a
question of an astronomer, partly because his science naturally
deals with the structure of the universe, which might give
some light as to its future, and partly because of his connection
with astrology, whose province it was supposed to be to
open the destiny of all things. Yet the question has been
answered by others than by astronomers, on grounds connected
with their faith. In the early ages of the Church, the belief
in the rapid approach of the end of the world was universally
spread amongst Christians. The Apocalypse of St. John and
the Acts of the Apostles seemed to announce its coming
before that generation passed away. Afterwards, it was expected
at the year 1000; and though these beliefs did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
rest in any way on astronomical grounds, yet to that science
was recourse had for encouragement or discouragement of the
idea. The middle ages, fall of simple faith and superstitious
credulity, were filled with fear of this terrible catastrophe.</p>

<p>As the year 1000 approached, the warnings became frequent
and very pressing. Thus, for example, Bernard of Thuringia,
about 960, began to announce publicly that the world was
about to end, declaring that he had had a particular revelation
of the fact. He took for his text the enigmatical words of
the Apocalypse: "At the end of one thousand years, Satan
shall be loosed from his prison, and shall seduce the people
that are in the four quarters of the earth. The book of life
shall be open, and the sea shall give up her dead." He
fixed the day when the Annunciation of the Virgin should
coincide with Good Friday as the end of all things. This
happened in 992, but nothing extraordinary happened.</p>

<p>During the tenth century the royal proclamations opened
by this characteristic phrase: <i>Whereas the end of the world is
approaching</i>....</p>

<p>In 1186 the astrologers frightened Europe by announcing a
conjunction of all the planets. Rigord, a writer of that
period, says in his <i>Life of Philip Augustus</i>: "The astrologers
of the East, Jews, Saracens, and even Christians, sent letters
all over the world, in which they predicted, with perfect
assurance, that in the month of September there would be
great tempests, earthquakes, mortality among men, seditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
and discords, revolutions in kingdoms, and the destruction of
all things. But," he adds, "the event very soon belied their
predictions."</p>

<p>Some years after, in 1198, another alarm of the end of the
world was raised, but this time it was not dependent on
celestial phenomena. It was said that Antichrist was
born in Babylon, and therefore all the human race would be
destroyed.</p>

<p>It would be a curious list to make of all the years in which
it was said that Antichrist was born; they might be counted
by hundreds, to say nothing of the future.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the fourteenth century, the
alchemist Arnault of Villeneuve announced the end of the
world for 1335. In his treatise <i>De Sigillis</i> he applies the
influence of the stars to alchemy, and expounds the mystical
formula by which demons are to be conjured.</p>

<p>St. Vincent Ferrier, a famous Spanish preacher, gave to
the world as many years' duration as there were verses in
the Psalms&mdash;about 2537.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century produced a very plentiful crop of
predictions of the final catastrophe. Simon Goulart, for
example, gave the world an appalling account of terrible
sights seen in Assyria&mdash;where a mountain opened and showed
a scroll with letters of Greek&mdash;"The end of the world is
coming." This was in 1532; but after that year had passed
in safety, Leovitius, a famous astrologer, predicted it again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
for 1584. Louis Gayon reports that the fright at this time
was great. The churches could not hold those who sought
a refuge in them, and a great number made their wills,
without reflecting that there was no use in it if the whole
world was to finish.</p>

<p>One of the most famous mathematicians of Europe, named
Stoffler, who flourished in the 16th century, and who worked
for a long time at the reform of the calendar proposed by
the Council of Constance, predicted a universal deluge for
1524. This deluge was to happen in the month of February,
because Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars were then together in
the sign of the Fishes. Everyone in Europe, Asia, and Africa,
to whom these tidings came, was in a state of consternation.
They expected a deluge, in spite of the rainbow. Many
contemporary authors report that the inhabitants of the
maritime provinces of Germany sold their lands for a mere
trifle to those who had more money and less credulity.
Each built himself a boat like an ark. A doctor of
Toulouse, named Auriol, made a very large ark for himself,
his family, and his friends, and the same precautions were
taken by a great many people in Italy. At last the month
of February came, and not a drop of rain fell. Never
was a drier month or a more puzzled set of astrologers.
Nevertheless they were not discouraged nor neglected for
all that, and Stoffler himself, associated with the celebrated
Regiomontanus, predicted once more that the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
world would come in 1588, or at least that there would
be frightful events which would overturn the earth.</p>

<p>This new prediction was a new deception; nothing
extraordinary occurred in 1588. The year 1572, however,
witnessed a strange phenomenon, capable of justifying all
their fears. An unknown star came suddenly into view in
the constellation of Cassiopeia, so brilliant that it was
visible even in full daylight, and the astrologers calculated
that it was the star of the Magi which had returned, and
that it announced the second coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were filled with
new predictions of great variety.</p>

<p>Even our own century has not been without such. A
religious work, published in 1826, by the Count Sallmard
Montfort, demonstrated perfectly that the world had no
more than ten years to exist. "The world," he said, "is
old, and its time of ending is near, and I believe that the
epoch of that terrible event is not far off. Jacob, the
chief of the twelve tribes of Israel, and consequently of the
ancient Church, was born in 2168 of the world, <i>i.e.</i>, 1836
<small>B.C.</small> The ancient Church, which was the figure of the
new, lasted 1836 years. Hence the new one will only last
till 1836 <small>A.D.</small>"</p>

<p>Similar prophecies by persons of various nations have
in like manner been made, without being fulfilled. Indeed,
we have had our own prophets; but they have proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
themselves incredulous of their own predictions, by taking
leases that should <i>commence</i> in the year of the world's
destruction.</p>

<p>But we have one in store for us yet. In 1840, Pierre
Louis of Paris calculated that the end would be in 1900,
and he calculated in this way:&mdash;The Apocalypse says the
Gentiles shall occupy the holy city for forty-two months. The
holy city was taken by Omar in 636. Forty-two months
of years is 1260, which brings the return of the Jews
to 1896, which will precede by a few years the final
catastrophe. Daniel also announces the arrival of Antichrist
2,300 days after the establishment of Artaxerxes
on the throne of Persia, 400 <small>B.C.</small>, which again brings us
to 1900.</p>

<p>Some again have put it at 2000 <small>A.D.</small>, which will make
6,000 years, as they think, from the creation; these are the
days of work; then comes the 1,000 years of millennial
sabbath.</p>

<p>We are led far away by these vain speculations from the
wholesome study of astronomy; they are useful only in
showing how by a little latitude that science may wind
itself into all the questions that in any way affect the
earth.</p>

<p>Indeed, since the world began, the world will doubtless
end, and astronomers are still asked how could it be
brought about?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly it is not an impossible event, and there are
only too many ways in which it has been imagined it
might occur.</p>

<p>The question is one that stands on a very different footing
from that it occupied before the days of Galileo and
Copernicus. <i>Then</i> the earth was believed to be the centre
of the universe, and all the heavens and stars created for it.
<i>Then</i> the commencement of the world was the commencement
of the universe, its destruction would be the destruction
of all. <i>Now</i>, thanks to the revolution in feeling that has been
accomplished by the progress of astronomy, we have learned
our own insignificance, and that amongst the infinite number
of stars, each supporting their own system of inhabited planets,
our earth occupies an infinitesimally small portion, and the
destruction of it would make no difference whatever&mdash;still
less its becoming uninhabitable. It is an event which
must have happened and be happening to other worlds,
without affecting the infinite life of the universe in any
marked degree.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for ourselves, the question remains as interesting
as if we were the all in all, but must be approached
in a different manner.</p>

<p>Numerous hypotheses have been put forth on the question
but they may mostly be dismissed as vain.</p>

<p>Buffon calculated that it had taken 74,832 years for the
earth to cool down to its present temperature, and that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
will take 93,291 years more before it would be too cold for
men to live upon it. But Sir William Thomson has shown
that the internal heat of the earth, supposed to be due to its
cooling from fusion, cannot have seriously modified climate
for a long series of years, and that life depends essentially
on the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis, the most ancient of all, is that which
supposes the earth will be destroyed by fire. It comes down
from Zoroaster and the Jews; and on the improbable supposition
of the thin crust of the earth over a molten mass,
this is thought possible. However, as the tendency in the
past has been all the other way, namely, to make the effect
of the inner heat of the earth less marked on the surface,
we have no reason to expect a reversal.</p>

<p>A third theory would make the earth die more gradually
and more surely. It is known that by the wearing down of
the surface by the rains and rivers, there is a tendency to
reduce mountains and all high parts of the earth to a
uniform level, a tendency which is only counteracted by some
elevating force within the earth. If these elevating forces
be supposed to be due to the internal heat&mdash;a hypothesis
which cannot be proved&mdash;then with the cooling of the earth
the elevating forces would cease, and, finally, the whole of
the continent would be brought beneath the sea and
terrestrial life perish.</p>

<p>Another interesting but groundless hypothesis is that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Adh&eacute;mar on the periodicity of deluges. This theory depends
on the fact of the unequal length of the seasons in the two
hemispheres. Our autumn and our winter last 179 days.
In the southern hemisphere they last 186 days. These seven
days, or 168 hours, of difference, increase each year the
coldness of the pole. During 10,500 years the ice accumulates
at one pole and melts at the other, thereby displacing
the earth's centre of gravity. Now a time will arrive when,
after the maximum of elevation of temperature on one
side, a catastrophe will happen, which will bring back the
centre of gravity to the centre of figure, and cause an
immense deluge. The deluge of the north pole was 4,200
years ago, therefore the next will be 6,300 hence. It is
very obvious to ask on this&mdash;<i>Why</i> should there be a
<i>catastrophe</i>? and why should not the centre of gravity
return <i>gradually</i> as it was gradually displaced?</p>

<p>Another theory has been that it would perish by a
comet. That it will not be by the shock we have already
seen from the light weight of the comet and from experience;
but it has been suggested that the gas may
combine with the air, and an explosion take place that
would destroy us all; but is not that also contradicted by
experience?</p>

<p>Another idea is that we shall finally fall into the sun by
the resistance of the ether to our motion. Encke's comet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
loses in thirty-three years a thousandth part of its velocity.
It appears then that we should have to wait millions of
centuries before we came too near the sun.</p>

<p>In reality, however, we are simply dependent on our sun,
and our destiny depends upon that.</p>

<p>In the first place, in its voyage through space it might
encounter or come within the range of some dark body we
at present know nothing of, and the attraction might put
out of harmony all our solar system with calamitous results.
Or since we are aware that the sun is a radiating body
giving out its heat on all sides, and therefore growing
colder, it may one day happen that it will be too cold to
sustain life on the earth. It is, we know, a variable star,
and stars have been seen to disappear, or even to have
a catastrophe happen to them, as the kindling of enormous
quantities of gas. A catastrophe in the sun will be our
own end.</p>

<p>Fontenelle has amusingly described in verse the result of
the sun growing cold, which may be thus Englished:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"Of this, though, I haven't a doubt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One day when there isn't much light,</span><br />
The poor little sun will go out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bid us politely&mdash;good-night.</span><br />
Look out from the stars up on high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some other to help you to see;</span><br />
I can't shine any longer, not I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since shining don't benefit me.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span><br />
"Then down on our poor habitation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What numberless evils will fall,</span><br />
When the heavens demand liquidation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why all will go smash, and then all</span><br />
Society come to an end.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon out of the sleepy affair</span><br />
His way will each traveller wend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No testament leaving, nor heir."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The cooling of the sun must, however, take place very
gradually, as no cooling has been perceived during the
existence of man; and the growth of plants in the earliest
geological ages, and the life of animals, prove that for so
long a time it has been within the limits within which life
has been possible&mdash;and we may look forward to as long in
the future.</p>

<p>It is not of course the time when the sun will become a
dark ball, surrounded by illuminated planets, that we must
reckon as the end of the earth. Life would have ceased
long before that stage&mdash;no man will witness the death of
the sun.</p>

<p>The diminution of the sun's heat would have for its
natural effect the enlargement of the glacial zones! the sea
and the land in those parts of the earth would cease to
support life, which would gradually be drawn closer to
the equatorial belt. Man, who by his nature and his intelligence
is best fitted to withstand cold climates, would remain
among the last of the inhabitants, reduced to the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
miserable nourishment. Drawn together round the equator,
the last of the sons of earth would wage a last combat
with death, and exactly as the shades approached, would the
human genius, fortified by all the acquirements of ages past&mdash;give
out its brightest light, and attempt in vain to throw
off the fatal cover that was destined to engulf him. At
last, the earth, fading, dry, and sterile, would become an
immense cemetery. And it would be the same with the
other planets. The sun, already become red, would at last
become black, and the planetary system would be an
assemblage of black balls revolving round a larger black
ball.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course this is all imaginary, and cannot affect ourselves,
but the very idea of it is melancholy, and enough
to justify the words of Campbell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noin">
"For this hath science searched on weary wing<br />
By shore and sea&mdash;each mute and living thing,<br />
Or round the cope her living chariot driven<br />
And wheeled in triumph through the signs of heaven.<br />
Oh, star-eyed science, hast thou wandered there<br />
To waft us home the message of despair?"<br />
</p></div>

<p>In reality, as we know nothing of the origin, so we know
nothing of the end of the world; and where so much has
been accomplished, there are obviously infinite possibilities
enough to satisfy the hopes of every one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>While some stars may be fading, others may be rising into
their place, and man need not be identified with one earth
alone, but may rest content in the idea that the life
universal is eternal.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
